<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>World Civilizations: Volume I: To 1700</h2><p>Adler and Pouwels&#39;s WORLD CIVILIZATIONS offers broad-based coverage of the world&#39;s major civilizations, in a brief-chapter format that presents information in manageable segments. The focused treatment of topics throughout history covers every major epoch and follows general patterns and processes, while illuminating history through specific examples and a particular emphasis on social and cultural topics.</p><p>Philip J. Adler taught college courses in world history to undergraduates for almost thirty years prior to his recent retirement. Dr. Adler earned his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna following military service overseas in the 1950s. His dissertation was on the activity of the South Slav emigres during World War I, and his academic specialty was the modern history of Eastern Europe and the Austro-Hungarian empire. His research has been supported by Fulbright and the National Endowment for the Humanities grants. Dr. Adler has published widely in the historical journals of the U.S. and German-speaking Europe. He is currently professor emeritus at East Carolina University, where he spent most of his teaching career.<br><br>Randall L. Pouwels earned his B.A. in history at the University of Wisconsin and his Ph.D. in history at UCLA. His Ph.D. dissertation was on the history of Islam in East Africa. His book, HORN AND CRESCENT: CULTURAL CHANGE AND TRADITIONAL ISLAM ON THE EAST AFRICAN COAST, 800-1900 (Cambridge, 1987), has become a standard work in African history. THE HISTORY OF ISLAM IN AFRICA (Athens, Oxford, and Cape Town, 2000) was jointly edited with Nehemia Levtzion of Hebrew University, Jerusalem. Widely praised in reviews, it was selected by Choice as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2001 and was made a selection of the History Book Club. In addition, he has written numerous articles and reviews on East African history, the history of Islam in Africa, and historical methodologies. Dr. Pouwels's other research interests include the history of the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, and the history and archaeology of Native Americans. Over the years, his work has been supported by grants and fellowships from Fulbright-Hays, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Studies Research Council, the National Geographic Society, and the American Philosophical Society. He taught African history for over twenty years at LaTrobe University in Melbourne, Australia, and at UCLA. He has been the Professor of African and Middle Eastern History at the University of Central Arkansas since 1984.</p><h2>Chrysler PT Cruiser 2001-2003 (Haynes Repair Manuals)</h2><p>Inside this manual you will find routine maintenance, tune-up procedures, engine repair, cooling and heating, air conditioning, fuel and exhaust, emissions control, ignition, brakes, suspension and steering, electrical systems, and wiring diagrams.</p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Volume II, meanwhile, turns to the basics of Japanese syntax. The book is by no means only about grammar, however. Rather, it is designed to help learners consolidate their understanding of syntactical structure through lessons that focus on how to talk about topics relevant to daily life. In addition to serving learners continuing from Volume I, Volume II will benefit those who have already studied beginning Japanese to some extent but wish to brush up on syntax.<br><br>Major Features of <i>Japanese for Busy People II</i>, Revised 3rd Edition<i>Japanese for Busy People II</i>, Revised 3rd Edition will enable learners to progress smoothly through the equivalent of the latter half of a typical first-year Japanese course while gradually building speaking and listening skills.<br><br>Learners approaching mid-beginner status often find themselves suddenly faced with syntax and vocabulary much more complex than what they have studied before. Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress.<br><br><i>Japanese for Busy People II</i>, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context.<br><br>Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows.<br><br>Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping<br>Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone&#x2019;s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item&#x2019;s characteristics. The overall theme is "picking souvenirs," a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options.<br><br>Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues<br>This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs &#x2014; a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences &#x2014; along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another&#x2019;s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding.<br><br>Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work<br>This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one&#x2019;s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them.<br><br>Unit 4: Planning a Vacation<br>Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan.<br><br>Unit 5: Solving Problems<br>The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.</p><p><b>The Association of Japanese-Language Teaching (AJALT)</b> was established to meet the practical needs of people who are not necessarily specialists in Japanese but who wish to communicate effectively.

Through these experiences, he has learned how to create environments that enable creative new ideas and solutions to emerge and be implemented even in the most challenging contexts. Here Kahane tells his stories and distills from them an approach that all of us can use to solve our own toughest problems.</p><p>"This breakthrough book addresses the central challenge of our time: finding a way to work together to solve the problems we have created." -Nelson Mandela <p>"Solving Tough Problems offers a new approach to addressing peacefully our most complex and conflictual challenges-at home, at work, and in the larger world. Kahane reflects candidly and insightfully on his rich experience working with corporations, governments, and civil society organizations around the world. A fresh and valuable contribution from a pioneering practitioner." -William Ury, Associate Director, Program on Negotiation, Harvard University, and co-author Getting to Yes and The Third Side </p><p>"This book is rich with insights and inspiring examples that are very relevant to the global challenges we face today. In a dynamic and complex world in which escalating violence is fueled by clashing ideologies, we would all be well advised to give up dictating and knowing and take up listening and learning." -Debra Dunn, Senior Vice President, Hewlett-Packard Company </p><p>"This book should be read by everyone who is concerned with the quality of decision-making in our democracies." -Elena Martinez, Assistant Secretary General, United Nations </p><p>"Adam Kahane's book makes a strong case, woven together from fascinating inside stories about the really tough problems in the world, that success or failure depends on their leaders learning or not learning to listen. The book is recommended reading for all decision takers who find themselves dealing with tough problems." -Arie de Geus, former Group Planning Coordinator, Royal Dutch/Shell, and author of The Living Company </p><p>"This is a profound and important book. It is special in both the simplicity and authenticity of the writing, and the value and far reaching impact of its message. It offers a ways of thinking and acting that can heal the woundedness of our organizations and our communities. I recommend it wholeheartedly." -Peter Block, author of Flawless Consulting, Stewardship, The Empowered Manager, The Answer to How Is Yes, and Freedom and Accountability at Work </p><p>"Many people have written about the healing power of dialogue. None, however, has put that power to the test under more extreme conditions with greater success than Adam Kahane. Informative, inspiring, and beautifully written. Highly recommended." -David Korten, President of the People-Centered Development Forum and author of When Corporations Rule the World </p><p>"This book includes the story of the Visi�n Guatemala team, in which a group of us, who in the ordinary course of events would never have met or worked together, had an unprecedented experience that opened up new horizons for us and for our country. Adam helped us cultivate our dreams and ideals, and gave us the energy and hope to act to renew our society." -Raquel Zelaya, former Cabinet Secretary of Peace, Guatemala </p><p>"Victory of the Open Heart speaks to the essence of true leadership: the capacity to sense and bring forth better futures. Kahane has a brilliant track record of helping highly diverse teams-within and across companies, governments, and civil society-lead together. In this beautiful, simple book, he reflects on his experiences and teaches us how we can, by changing how we work together and are together, change the world." -Joseph Jaworski, Chairman of the Global Leadership Project and author of Synchronicity: The Inner Path of Leadership </p><p>"A book that needs to be read everywhere people have differences-in politics, the church, labor, the academy, and business. Kahane's message is wise, honest, and above all realistic. A gift for our time." -W. Brian Arthur, Citibank Professor, Santa Fe Institute </p><p>"A defining feature of our era is problems for which authoritarian, hierarchical leadership is inadequate. This book offers a rare glimpse into the profound personal and systemic shifts that can happen in settings when people give up waiting a solution from "on high" and begin to truly talk and listen to one another." -Peter Senge, Senior Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of technology; Chairman of the Society for Organizational Learning; author of The Fifth Discipline, The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook and The Dance of Change </p><p>"A seminal book. Exciting, vital, and essential reading." -Edgar H. Schein, Sloan Fellows Professor of Management Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of Management and author of Process Consulting </p><p>"This book offers us stories of profound transformation-and with a refreshing directness teaches us ways of talking and listening that can embrace the toughest problems. The packing of so much practical wisdom into such a small space creates a jewel of inspiration." -Betty Sue Flowers, Director, LBJ Library </p><p>"Adam Kahane is one of those rare action-intellectuals who combines a deep theoretical understanding of social change and group process with actual experience in situations of conflict and turmoil, where people are desperate for solutions but unable to secure what they need. Adam brings the catalyst for change." -James Garrison, President of State of the World Forum </p><p>"This book is a gem. It explains simply and eloquently the essence of the process of non-violent, voluntary transformational change in social systems that seem stuck in hopelessness. This book is in a class of its own." -Arun Maira, Chairman, The Boston Consulting Group India </p><p>"Adam Kahane has written a useful and powerful book. It turns out that the rational, structured approach is just the beginning. Success occurs only when people deeply listen and talk with each other." -Harrison Owen, author of Expanding Our Now, Tales from Open Space, and Open Space Technology "Adam Kahane pens his mind and heart in prose reminiscent of personal letters to an intelligent friend. His theme is simple and admirable: how to replace the power of violence with the power of listening-and-talking, of regenerative dialogue. His stories move me, unveiling, as no other book, how the informed and reflective heart is the essential compliment to rational, strategic thought." -Peter Warshall, editor, Whole Earth, the magazine of the Whole Earth Catalog </p><p>"Kahane puts into words wisdom glimpsed from the cauldron of real world experience. He renews our hope that it is possible to map a better future and sustains our faith that the heart can be a guide." -Alan Briskin, author of The Stirring of Soul in the Workplace </p><p>"Adam Kahane is one of those all too rare "warriors for peace" who is willing to immerse himself totally into our world's most intractable conflicts. In story after story, one witnesses the remarkable transformation of isolated individuals-separate, hostile, closed to one another, with fixed positions-into a single, complex, organism with a common goal, fresh thinking, and, most of all, hope. Kahane makes it crystal clear that deep talking and listening do not come easily, but when they do, the world moves." -Barry Oshry, author of Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life and Leading Systems: Lessons from the Power Lab </p><p>"Adam Kahane's book invites us to dare move back into that sacred space of silence: a space where we listen and hear with our hearts and not only with our heads. The stories he tells celebrate the amazing transformation that takes place when we have the courage to be vulnerable and speak openly and honestly: where passion is not used to defend an ideology or position, but is directed at enhancing a shared commitment for a common purpose. It is a book that needs to be read now."

Outhouse Draw, Nevada. In the early twentieth century, it was common for towns and geographical features to have salacious, bawdy, and even derogatory names. In the age before political correctness, mapmakers readily accepted any local preference for place names, prizing accurate representation over standards of decorum. Thus, summits such as Squaw Tit&#x2014;which towered above valleys in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and California&#x2014;found their way into the cartographic annals. Later, when sanctions prohibited local use of racially, ethnically, and scatalogically offensive toponyms, town names like Jap Valley, California, were erased from the national and cultural map forever.&nbsp;<br><br><i>From Squaw Tit to Whorehouse Meadow</i> probes this little-known chapter in American cartographic history by considering the intersecting efforts to computerize mapmaking, standardize geographic names, and respond to public concern over ethnically offensive appellations. Interweaving cartographic history with tales of politics and power, celebrated geographer Mark Monmonier locates his story within the past and present struggles of mapmakers to create an orderly process for naming that avoids confusion, preserves history, and serves different political aims. Anchored by a diverse selection of naming controversies&#x2014;in the United States, Canada, Cyprus, Israel, Palestine, and Antarctica; on the ocean floor and the surface of the moon; and in other parts of our solar system&#x2014;<i>From Squaw Tit to Whorehouse Meadow </i>richly reveals the map&#x2019;s role as a mediated portrait of the cultural landscape. And unlike other books that consider place names, this is the first to reflect on both the real cartographic and political imbroglios they engender.&nbsp;<br><br><i>From Squaw Tit to Whorehouse Meadow </i>is Mark Monmonier at his finest: a learned analysis of a timely and controversial subject rendered accessible&#x2014;and even entertaining&#x2014;to the general reader.</p><p><p><b>Mark Monmonier</b> is Distinguished Professor of Geography at Syracuse University&#x2019;s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. He is the author of more than twenty books and the editor of volume 6 of the History of Cartography series, published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>"Engaging...a trove of giggle-inducing lore." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-02-20)<br><br>"Why did India block distribution of an updated version of Microsoft's Windows 95? Is it Mount McKinley or Mount Denali, Hawaii or Hawai'i? Monmonier (geography, Syracuse Univ.; Spying with Maps) answers these questions and more as he reveals in a nontechnical manner the impact of governmental policy and political correctness upon modern cartography. The reader is introduced to the agencies responsible for proposing and approving name changes and spellings, among them the U.S. Board of Geographic Names (BGN) and the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN). The first four chapters explore recent attempts to find acceptable replacements for place names, primarily in the United States, containing pejorative ethnic or risqu� terms (as in the book's title). One chapter is devoted to the movement to restore indigenous forms and spellings (as in Mount Denali). The remainder of the book examines international disputes over Kashmir, the Sea of Japan, and the more ominous use of maps with nameschanged to "erase" the presence of displaced populations (e.g., the disappearance of Greek names for villages in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and similarly of Palestinian village names on Israeli maps).

(<i>The Economist</i> 2006-06-15)<br><br>"Fascinating. . . . The book will interest anyone who has ever wondered how place names have come to be established by locals, and then come to endure on maps&#x2014;at least until the advance of political correctness."<p></p> (Susan Gole <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2006-07-14)<br><br>"A funny book...What Monmonier provides is a running commentary on 'risqu� toponyms' and the attempts to censor them by disapproving authorities &#x2013; frequently protested or prevented by locals who&#x2019;d learnt to love living in, for example, Intercourse, Pennsylvania, or Wee Wee Hill in Indiana."

It tells the story of Tony Last, who, to the irritation of his wife, is inordinately obsessed with his Victorian Gothic country house and life. When Lady Brenda Last embarks on an affair with the worthless John Beaver out of boredom with her husband, she sets in motion a sequence of tragicomic disasters that reveal Waugh at his most scathing. <br><br>The action is set in the brittle social world recognizable from Decline and Fall and Vile Bodies, darkened and deepened by Waugh&#x2019;s own experience of sexual betrayal. As Tony is driven by the urbane savagery of this world to seek solace in the wilds of the Brazilian jungle, <i>A Handful of Dust </i> demonstrates the incomparably brilliant and wicked wit of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most accomplished novelists.</p><p><i>"All over England people were waking up, queasy and despondent."</i><p> Few writers have walked the line between farce and tragedy as nimbly as Evelyn Waugh, who employed the conventions of the comic novel to chip away at the already crumbling English class system. His 1934 novel, <i>A Handful of Dust</i>, is a sublime example of his bleak satirical style: a mordantly funny expos� of aristocratic decadence and ennui in England between the wars.</p><p> Tony Last is an aristocrat whose attachment to an ideal feudal past is so profound that he is blind to his wife Brenda's boredom with the stately rhythms of country life. While he earnestly plays the lord of the manor in his ghastly Victorian Gothic pile, she sets herself up in a London flat and pursues an affair with the social-climbing idler John Beaver. In the first half of the novel Waugh fearlessly anatomizes the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Everyone moves through an endless cycle of parties and country-house weekends, being scrupulously polite in public and utterly horrid in private. Sex is something one does to relieve the boredom, and Brenda's affair provides a welcome subject for conversation: </p><blockquote> It had been an autumn of very sparse and meagre romance; only the most obvious people had parted or come together, and Brenda was filling a want long felt by those whose simple, vicarious pleasure it was to discuss the subject in bed over the telephone. </blockquote> Tony's indifference and Brenda's selfishness give their relationship a sort of equilibrium until tragedy forces them to face facts. The collapse of their relationship accelerates, and in the famous final section of the book Tony seeks solace in a foolhardy search for El Dorado, throwing himself on the mercy of a jungle only slightly more savage than the one he leaves behind in England. For all its biting wit, <i>A Handful of Dust</i> paints a bleak picture of the English upper classes, reaching beyond satire toward a very modern sense of despair. In Waugh's world, culture, breeding, and the trappings of civilization only provide more subtle means of destruction. <i>--Simon Leake</i>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees</h2><p>This book is an account of two dimension of state and nation building in France and Spain since the seventeenth century--the invention of a national boundary line and the making of Frenchmen and Spaniards. It is also a history of Catalan rural society in the Cerdanya, a valley in the eastern Pyrenees divided between Spain and France in 1659. This study shuttles between two levels, between the center and the periphery. It connects the "macroscopic" political and diplomatic history of France and Spain, from the Old Regime monarchies to the national territorial states of the later nineteenth century; and the "molecular" history--the historical ethnography--of Catalan village communities, rural nobles, and peasants in the borderland. On the frontier, these two histories come together, and they can be told as one.&nbsp;</p><p>"A brilliant, long-range sociological study . . . This fascinating exploration through three centuries of the frontier is rounded off with a perceptive and balanced appraisal of the nature of national identity within the context of the Pyrenees . . . . This is a study which is exciting, learned and thought-provoking, a splendid example of interdisciplinary history at its best." --Henry Kamen, Times Literary Supplement&nbsp;"Peter Sahlins gives us a magnificent lesson in interdisciplinary scholarship on a very basic theme: how the identity of individuals, their families, and their villages on both sides of the boundary has been shaped by their belonging to two different states--states whose development, moreover, has proceeded very differently. I had always hoped for a study of the 'boundary phenomenon,' and Peter Sahlins' work has answered my wish." --Pierre Vilar, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales&nbsp;"I can see this book finding a privileged place on the shelves of European historians. Beyond this it will certainly be of interest to anthropologists, sociologists, and other concerned with the problems of ethnicity; and it should excite the interest of political scientists as well." --Eric R. Wolf, City University of New York&nbsp;<b>Peter Sahlins</b> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>How Math Works</h2><p>Fascinating explanations, activities, profiles of history&#39;s most noted mathematical thinkers, and experiments introduce young readers to the world of mathematics and demonstrate how math fundamentals are a significant part of every day life.</p><p>Gr. 5^-8. With a book jacket statement, "100 Ways Parents and Kids Can Share the Wonders of Mathematics," this large-format compendium offers many activities as well as brief discussions of math concepts and history. Projects include creating a hopscotch game to demonstrate positive and negative numbers, comparing the ratios of objects with their shadows, and making a spirit level. Sometimes an activity's connection to mathematics seems tenuous (making a magic wallet or a pinhole camera). Each double-page spread focuses on a particular subject within one of the seven broad headings: numbers, proportions, algebra, statistics, measurement, shape, and thinking. The pages' bright, crisp colors are crowded with many small, white-background photos as well as experiments, projects, and sidebars. The approach may be scattershot, but some of the projects will hit the target, providing ideas that parents and teachers can use in teaching math to children. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Barchester Towers</h2><p>The appointment of a new bishop and the ensuing conflicts and intrigue form the basis of this satire of the clergy</p><p>This 1857 sequel to The Warden wryly chronicles the struggle for control of the English diocese of Barchester.

This generously illustrated book, which accompanies a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is the first comprehensive examination of California's mid-century modern design. It begins by tracing the origins of a distinctively California modernism in the 1930s by such European �migr�s as Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Kem Weber; it finds other specific design influences and innovations in solid-color commercial ceramics, inspirations from Mexico and Asia, new schools for design training, new concepts about leisure, and the conversion of wartime technologies to peacetime use (exemplified by Charles and Ray Eames's plywood and fiberglass furniture).</p><p>The heart of <i>California Design</i> is the modern California home, famously characterized by open plans conducive to outdoor living. The layouts of modernist homes by Pierre Koenig, Craig Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, for example, were intended to blur the distinction between indoors and out. Homes were furnished with products from Heath Ceramics, Van Keppel-Green, and Architectural Pottery as well as other, previously unheralded companies and designers. Many objects were designed to be multifunctional: pool and patio furniture that was equally suitable indoors, lighting that was both task and ambient, bookshelves that served as room dividers, and bathing suits that would turn into ensembles appropriate for indoor entertainment.</p><p><i>California Design</i> includes 350 images, most in color, of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, architecture, graphic and industrial design, film, textiles, and fashion, and ten incisive essays that trace the rise of the California design aesthetic.</p></p><p>Wendy Kaplan is Department Head and Curator of Decorative Arts and Design at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.<p>This book beautifully documents how climate, immigration, and industry influenced California's modern design aesthetic.</p>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><p>...[F]ascinating stuff, rich with detail and new discoveries.</p>&#x2015;<i>NZ House and Garden</i></p><h2>Covenant with Death</h2><p><p><b><i>Stirringly told from the view of everyday soldiers, </i>Covenant with Death<i> is acclaimed as one of the greatest novels about war ever written.

Using the Patient Impairment Profile method, practitioners can convincingly convey a clinical rationale for treatment, efficiently track progress over time, and demonstrate favorable patient outcomes.</p><p>Keeping pace with the evolving and expanding presence of managed care, the authors have extensively revised and enlarged the previous edition. New clinical research on the validity and reliability of the impairment terminology has produced a much-improved, clinically valid, and statistically reliable impairment lexicon. Detailed severity rating qualifiers, reference lists of patient objectives, and a useful glossary have been added. All regulations have also been updated.</p><p>Managing Managed Care II is reference and valuable resource for mental health practitioners and for the individuals who monitor and review treatment.

The discussions of the linguistic confusion regarding goals, objectives, and treatment plans in both managed care and provider sectors is both amusing and on the mark, and the authors' reformulations are lucid. Practitioners bewildered by the diversity of questions and standards used by their managed care plans or frustrated at their reimbursement denials will probably find the documentation method and suggested data structures helpful in reducing managed care denials....

Discussion of collectible cel art soon slips away, though, as the object becomes not to evaluate Warner animation, but to praise it on big, lavishly illustrated pages that are bound for heavy duty. Exhaustiveness is not a concern: Beck and Friedwald spotlight a lesser character like Michigan J. Frog, but not many others, mostly, it seems, because M. J. is the spokes-'toon for Warner's TV network. Still, there is plenty of tribute to major creative stalwarts like voice man Mel Blanc and directors Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Bob McKimson, Tex Avery, and Chuck Jones. The upbeat exposition even cites a few controversies, such as the trimming of <i>Heckling Hare</i> that contributed to Avery's leaving Warner (what the original ending was or why it was changed are never specified, though). Mickey Mouse may be a more successful corporate shill, but Bugs Bunny is the quintessential funny animal.

Krutnik recasts the films within a generic framework and draws on recent historical and theoretical research to examine both the diversity of film noir and its significance within American popular culture of the 1940s. He considers classical Hollywood cinema, debates on genre, and the history of the emergence of character in film noir, focusing on the hard-boiled' crime fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain as well as the popularisationof Freudian psychoanalysis; and the social and cultural upheavals of the 1940s.</p> <p>The core of this book however concerns the complex representationof masculinity in the noir tough' thriller, and where and how gender interlocks with questions of genre. Analysing in detail major thrillers like <em>The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Out of the Past </em>and <em>The Killers </em>, alongside lesser known but nonetheless crucial films as <em>Stranger on the Third Floor, Pitfall </em>and <em>Dead Reckoning</em> Krutnik has produced a provocative and highly readable study of one of Hollywood most perennially fascinating groups of films. </p></p><p><strong>Dr. Frank Krutnik</strong> is Reader in Film Studies at the University of Sussex, UK.</p><h2>World Civilizations</h2><p>Adler and Pouwels&#39;s WORLD CIVILIZATIONS offers broad-based coverage of the world&#39;s major civilizations, in a brief-chapter format that presents information in manageable segments.

The status quo is no longer an option.<br> <br>In <i>This Changes Everything </i>Naomi Klein argues that climate change isn&#x2019;t just another issue to be neatly filed between taxes and health care. It&#x2019;s an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways. Klein meticulously builds the case for how massively reducing our greenhouse emissions is our best chance to simultaneously reduce gaping inequalities, re-imagine our broken democracies, and rebuild our gutted local economies. She exposes the ideological desperation of the climate-change deniers, the messianic delusions of the would-be geoengineers, and the tragic defeatism of too many mainstream green initiatives. And she demonstrates precisely why the market has not&#x2014;and cannot&#x2014;fix the climate crisis but will instead make things worse, with ever more extreme and ecologically damaging extraction methods, accompanied by rampant disaster capitalism.<br> <br>Klein argues that the changes to our relationship with nature and one another that are required to respond to the climate crisis humanely should not be viewed as grim penance, but rather as a kind of gift&#x2014;a catalyst to transform broken economic and cultural priorities and to heal long-festering historical wounds. And she documents the inspiring movements that have already begun this process: communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel extraction but are building the next, regeneration-based economies right now.<br> <br>Can we pull off these changes in time? Nothing is certain. Nothing except that climate change changes everything. And for a very brief time, the nature of that change is still up to us.</p><p>Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist, and author of the <i>New York Times </i>and #1 international bestseller <i>The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism</i>.

She lives in Toronto.This Changes Everything Introduction<p></p> ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, EVERYTHING CHANGES<p></p> <br>&#x201c;Most projections of climate change presume that future changes&#x2014;greenhouse gas emissions, temperature increases and effects such as sea level rise&#x2014;will happen incrementally. A given amount of emission will lead to a given amount of temperature increase that will lead to a given amount of smooth incremental sea level rise. However, the geological record for the climate reflects instances where a relatively small change in one element of climate led to abrupt changes in the system as a whole. In other words, pushing global temperatures past certain thresholds could trigger abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and large-scale impacts. At that point, even if we do not add any additional CO2 to the atmosphere, potentially unstoppable processes are set in motion. We can think of this as sudden climate brake and steering failure where the problem and its consequences are no longer something we can control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world&#x2019;s largest general scientific society, 20141<br> <br>&#x201c;I love that smell of the emissions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Sarah Palin, 20112<br> <br>A voice came over the intercom: would the passengers of Flight 3935, scheduled to depart Washington, D.C., for Charleston, South Carolina, kindly collect their carry-on luggage and get off the plane.<br> <br>They went down the stairs and gathered on the hot tarmac. There they saw something unusual: the wheels of the US Airways jet had sunk into the black pavement as if it were wet cement. The wheels were lodged so deep, in fact, that the truck that came to tow the plane away couldn&#x2019;t pry it loose. The airline had hoped that without the added weight of the flight&#x2019;s thirty-five passengers, the aircraft would be light enough to pull. It wasn&#x2019;t. Someone posted a picture: &#x201c;Why is my flight cancelled? Because DC is so damn hot that our plane sank 4" into the pavement.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Eventually, a larger, more powerful vehicle was brought in to tow the plane and this time it worked; the plane finally took off, three hours behind schedule. A spokesperson for the airline blamed the incident on &#x201c;very unusual temperatures.&#x201d;4<br> <br>The temperatures in the summer of 2012 were indeed unusually hot. (As they were the year before and the year after.) And it&#x2019;s no mystery why this has been happening: the profligate burning of fossil fuels, the very thing that US Airways was bound and determined to do despite the inconvenience presented by a melting tarmac. This irony&#x2014;the fact that the burning of fossil fuels is so radically changing our climate that it is getting in the way of our capacity to burn fossil fuels&#x2014;did not stop the passengers of Flight 3935 from reembarking and continuing their journeys. Nor was climate change mentioned in any of the major news coverage of the incident.<br> <br>I am in no position to judge these passengers. All of us who live high consumer lifestyles, wherever we happen to reside, are, metaphorically, passengers on Flight 3935. Faced with a crisis that threatens our survival as a species, our entire culture is continuing to do the very thing that caused the crisis, only with an extra dose of elbow grease behind it. Like the airline bringing in a truck with a more powerful engine to tow that plane, the global economy is upping the ante from conventional sources of fossil fuels to even dirtier and more dangerous versions&#x2014;bitumen from the Alberta tar sands, oil from deepwater drilling, gas from hydraulic fracturing (fracking), coal from detonated mountains, and so on.<br> <br>Meanwhile, each supercharged natural disaster produces new irony-laden snapshots of a climate increasingly inhospitable to the very industries most responsible for its warming. Like the 2013 historic floods in Calgary that forced the head offices of the oil companies mining the Alberta tar sands to go dark and send their employees home, while a train carrying flammable petroleum products teetered on the edge of a disintegrating rail bridge. Or the drought that hit the Mississippi River one year earlier, pushing water levels so low that barges loaded with oil and coal were unable to move for days, while they waited for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a channel (they had to appropriate funds allocated to rebuild from the previous year&#x2019;s historic flooding along the same waterway). Or the coal-fired power plants in other parts of the country that were temporarily shut down because the waterways that they draw on to cool their machinery were either too hot or too dry (or, in some cases, both).<br> <br>Living with this kind of cognitive dissonance is simply part of being alive in this jarring moment in history, when a crisis we have been studiously ignoring is hitting us in the face&#x2014;and yet we are doubling down on the stuff that is causing the crisis in the first place.<br> <br>I denied climate change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. Not like Donald Trump and the Tea Partiers going on about how the continued existence of winter proves it&#x2019;s all a hoax. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most of the news stories, especially the really scary ones. I told myself the science was too complicated and that the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my &#x201c;elite&#x201d; frequent flyer status.<br> <br>A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke (&#x201c;more signs of the Apocalypse!&#x201d;). Which is another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it (&#x201c;dollar for dollar it&#x2019;s more efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is the best protection from weather extremes&#x201d;)&#x2014;as if having a few more dollars will make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking away if you happen to be a policy wonk.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant and abstract&#x2014;even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate and shop at farmers&#x2019; markets and stop driving&#x2014;but forget trying to actually change the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that&#x2019;s too much &#x201c;bad energy&#x201d; and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still have one eye tightly shut.<br> <br>Or maybe we do look&#x2014;really look&#x2014;but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it&#x2019;s hard to keep it in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.5<br> <br>We know that if we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, climate change will change everything about our world. Major cities will very likely drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas, and there is a very high chance that our children will spend a great deal of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. And we don&#x2019;t have to do anything to bring about this future. All we have to do is nothing. Just continue to do what we are doing now, whether it&#x2019;s counting on a techno-fix or tending to our gardens or telling ourselves we&#x2019;re unfortunately too busy to deal with it.<br> <br>All we have to do is not react as if this is a full-blown crisis. All we have to do is keep on denying how frightened we actually are. And then, bit by bit, we will have arrived at the place we most fear, the thing from which we have been averting our eyes. No additional effort required.<br> <br>There are ways of preventing this grim future, or at least making it a lot less dire. But the catch is that these also involve changing everything. For us high consumers, it involves changing how we live, how our economies function, even the stories we tell about our place on earth. The good news is that many of these changes are distinctly un-catastrophic. Many are downright exciting. But I didn&#x2019;t discover this for a long while.<br> <br>I remember the precise moment when I stopped averting my eyes to the reality of climate change, or at least when I first allowed my eyes to rest there for a good while. It was in Geneva, in April 2009, and I was meeting with Bolivia&#x2019;s ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO), who was then a surprisingly young woman named Ang�lica Navarro Llanos. Bolivia being a poor country with a small international budget, Navarro Llanos had recently taken on the climate portfolio in addition to her trade responsibilities. Over lunch in an empty Chinese restaurant, she explained to me (using chopsticks as props to make a graph of the global emission trajectory) that she saw climate change both as a terrible threat to her people&#x2014;but also an opportunity.<br> <br>A threat for the obvious reasons: Bolivia is extraordinarily dependent on glaciers for its drinking and irrigation water and those white-capped mountains that tower over its capital were turning gray and brown at an alarming rate. The opportunity, Navarro Llanos said, was that since countries like hers had done almost nothing to send emissions soaring, they were in a position to declare themselves &#x201c;climate creditors,&#x201d; owed money and technology support from the large emitters to defray the hefty costs of coping with more climate-related disasters, as well as to help them develop on a green energy path.<br> <br>She had recently given a speech at a United Nations climate conference in which she laid out the case for these kinds of wealth transfers, and she gave me a copy. &#x201c;Millions of people,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;in small islands, least-developed countries, landlocked countries as well as vulnerable communities in Brazil, India and China, and all around the world&#x2014;are suffering from the effects of a problem to which they did not contribute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we are to curb emissions in the next decade, we need a massive mobilization larger than any in history. We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth. This plan must mobilize financing and technology transfer on scales never seen before. It must get technology onto the ground in every country to ensure we reduce emissions while raising people&#x2019;s quality of life. We have only a decade.&#x201d;6<br> <br>Of course a Marshall Plan for the Earth would be very costly&#x2014;hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars (Navarro Llanos was reluctant to name a figure). And one might have thought that the cost alone would make it a nonstarter&#x2014;after all, this was 2009 and the global financial crisis was in full swing. Yet the grinding logic of austerity&#x2014;passing on the bankers&#x2019; bills to the people in the form of public sector layoffs, school closures, and the like&#x2014;had not yet been normalized. So rather than making Navarro Llanos&#x2019;s ideas seem less plausible, the crisis had the opposite effect.<br> <br>We had all just watched as trillions of dollars were marshaled in a moment when our elites decided to declare a crisis. If the banks were allowed to fail, we were told, the rest of the economy would collapse. It was a matter of collective survival, so the money had to be found. In the process, some rather large fictions at the heart of our economic system were exposed (Need more money? Print some!). A few years earlier, governments took a similar approach to public finances after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In many Western countries, when it came to constructing the security/surveillance state at home and waging war abroad, budgets never seemed to be an issue.<br> <br>Climate change has never received the crisis treatment from our leaders, despite the fact that it carries the risk of destroying lives on a vastly greater scale than collapsed banks or collapsed buildings. The cuts to our greenhouse gas emissions that scientists tell us are necessary in order to greatly reduce the risk of catastrophe are treated as nothing more than gentle suggestions, actions that can be put off pretty much indefinitely. Clearly, what gets declared a crisis is an expression of power and priorities as much as hard facts. But we need not be spectators in all this: politicians aren&#x2019;t the only ones with the power to declare a crisis. Mass movements of regular people can declare one too.<br> <br>Slavery wasn&#x2019;t a crisis for British and American elites until abolitionism turned it into one. Racial discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the civil rights movement turned it into one. Sex discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until feminism turned it into one. Apartheid wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the anti-apartheid movement turned it into one.<br> <br>In the very same way, if enough of us stop looking away and decide that climate change is a crisis worthy of Marshall Plan levels of response, then it will become one, and the political class will have to respond, both by making resources available and by bending the free market rules that have proven so pliable when elite interests are in peril. We occasionally catch glimpses of this potential when a crisis puts climate change at the front of our minds for a while. &#x201c;Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed for it will be spent,&#x201d; declared British prime minister David Cameron&#x2014;Mr. Austerity himself&#x2014;when large parts of his country were underwater from historic flooding in February 2014 and the public was enraged that his government was not doing more to help.7<br> <br>Listening to Navarro Llanos describe Bolivia&#x2019;s perspective, I began to understand how climate change&#x2014;if treated as a true planetary emergency akin to those rising flood waters&#x2014;could become a galvanizing force for humanity, leaving us all not just safer from extreme weather, but with societies that are safer and fairer in all kinds of other ways as well. The resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swaths of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity. This is a vision of the future that goes beyond just surviving or enduring climate change, beyond &#x201c;mitigating&#x201d; and &#x201c;adapting&#x201d; to it in the grim language of the United Nations. It is a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere that seems, frankly, better than where we are right now.<br> <br>After that conversation, I found that I no longer feared immersing myself in the scientific reality of the climate threat. I stopped avoiding the articles and the scientific studies and read everything I could find. I also stopped outsourcing the problem to the environmentalists, stopped telling myself this was somebody else&#x2019;s issue, somebody else&#x2019;s job. And through conversations with others in the growing climate justice movement, I began to see all kinds of ways that climate change could become a catalyzing force for positive change&#x2014;how it could be the best argument progressi...</p><h2>Annotations to Finnegans Wake</h2><p><p>Long considered the essential guide to Joyce's famously difficult work, Roland McHugh's <i>Annotations to "Finnegans Wake"</i> provides both novice readers and seasoned Joyceans with a wealth of information in an easy-to-use format uniquely suited to this densely layered text.

The reader can thus look directly from text to notes and back again, with no need to consult separate glossaries or other listings.</p><p>McHugh's richly detailed notes distill decades of scholarship, explicating foreign words, unusual English connotations and colloquial expressions, place names, historical events, song titles and quotations, parodies of other texts, and Joyce's diverse literary and popular sources.

Will economic affluence inevitably lead to political change, bringing on yet another communist collapse? Having possessed for decades the greatest population on earth, and now controlling what will shortly be the planet's largest economy, China is a nation that commands the respect, awe, and vested interest of an entire globe. The long path leading to the crossroads at which she now stands constitutes one of the most complex and unlikely chronicles in the history of civilization.<br> From traditional, xenophopic empire to modern economic powerhouse, China's epic story since the seventeenth century is brought vividly to life in this latest edition of Immanuel C.Y. Hsu's monumental survey. Updated to incorporate the tumultuous events of the late '80s and early '90s, this classic text recounts in detail the response of China's leadership to the collapse of European communism, illustrates the unorthodox methods behind the nation's recent economic resurgence, and further analyzes the effects of the violent crackdown at Tienanmen Square. Taiwan's transition to constitutional democracy is also discussed, as well as the possible, and very problematic, reunification with the mainland.<br> Unmatched in depth and comprehensiveness, this extraordinary work continues, as no other text can, to bring modern China's fascinating past into focus for students of her history, politics, and culture.</p><p>Immanuel C.

Potty Training. </i></b><br><br>Toddlers&#x2014;commonly defined as children aged between two and five years old&#x2014;can be a horribly misunderstood bunch. What most parents view as bad behavior is in fact just curious behavior. Toddlerdom is the age of individuation, seeking control, and above all, learning how the world works. But this misunderstanding between parents and child can lead to power struggles, tantrums, and even diminished growth and creativity.<br> <br>The recent push of early intellectualism coupled with a desire to &#x201c;make childhood magical&#x201d; has created a strange paradox&#x2014;we have three-year-olds with math and Mandarin tutors who don&#x2019;t know how to dress themselves and are sitting in their own poop. We are pushing the toddler mind beyond its limit but simultaneously keeping them far below their own natural capabilities.<br> <br>In the frank, funny, and totally authentic <i>Oh Crap! I Have a Toddler</i>, social worker Jamie Glowacki helps parents work through what she considers the five essential components of raising toddlers:<br> <br>&#x2014;Engaging the toddler mind<br> &#x2014;Working with the toddler body<br> &#x2014;Understanding and dealing with the toddler behavior<br> &#x2014;Creating a good toddler environment<br> &#x2014;You, the parent<br> <br><i>Oh Crap!

With her signature down-and-dirty, friend-to-friend advice, Jamie is here to help you experience the joy of parenting again and giving your child&#x2014;and yourself&#x2014;the freedom to let them grow at their own pace and become who they are.</p><p>Jamie Glowacki is an internationally recognized potty training and parenting expert.

A breezy and memorable read.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</b><br><br>&#x201c;Jamie Glowacki definitely has cred... Her book offers plenty of sage advice in often amusing prose, backed up by examples of toddler dilemmas she&#x2019;s helped solve. Her recommendations may challenge your instincts or long-held beliefs, but she offers solid evidence for encouraging risky play, allowing kids to sometimes work out their own rules and issues, and making space for physicality and something she calls &#x2018;Big Play&#x2019;... She offers a well-reasoned toolbox of effective alternatives [to time-outs] to address those tricky toddler meltdowns, and by gum, she has me completely convinced. <i>Oh Crap!

Mastering the Ride is his follow-up book to one that put him on the map, Proficient Motorcycling, and it goes one better. For motorcyclists ready to take their rides to the next level, Mastering the Ride is an exhilarating course in skills, safety, and common sense. Hough&#x2019;s writing style is straightforward and conversational, never professorial, preachy, or boring. With instructional color photographs and drawings, the book covers improving the rider&#x2019;s skills of speed and passing on superslabs, mountain roads, and city streets; anticipating and handling street and road hazards, from treacherous tar snakes to lane-weaving drivers; and learning the limits of sight distances, executing quick stops at sudden hazards as well as curves. The book devotes two full chapters to the skills involved in mastering cornering, with specific advice about rolling on and off the throttle, shifting, braking, countersteering, body steering and positioning, and cornering lines.<br><br>In the chapter Mastering the Art of Conspicuity,&#x201d; Hough recommends riders understand and employ conspicuity, that is understanding how motorcyclists and car drivers see their surroundings and getting others to see you on the road by use of hi-viz clothing, LED lights, and other gear. The key to safety rests in increased situational awareness the topic of the next chapter the ability to predict how road events will unfold by thinking through the possibilities way before a potential hazard presents itself. Thanks to Hough&#x2019;s direct and specific instructions to riders for what they need to know, to improve, to avoid, and to do every time they get on their bikes, this chapter and the skills it describes are nothing short of life-saving.<br><br>In short, Mastering the Ride is a crash course in how not to crash that is, after all is read and done, what every motorcyclists must avoid for his own life and the lives of others on the road. As Eric Trow, a motorcycle safety journalist and instructor states on the back cover, Mastering the Ride should be required reading for every road-going motorcyclist and become the companion of any rider serious about advancing his or her road craft.&#x201d; Voni Glaves, the record-setting million-mile BMW rider, is a long-time Hough fan who relied on Hough&#x2019;s wisdom&#x201d; back in the 1970s when the author was a columnist. The latest from David brings together his years of experience and his unique analysis to make the case for mastery in a conversational way that makes [Mastering the Ride] impossible to put down. The breadth and depth of the information is astounding.&#x201d;<br><br>A section on the aging rider, including ways to compensate for older riders&#x2019; slower reaction times and readapting their skills, is included in the appendix, as is a travelogue of Hough&#x2019;s road trips to some of his favorite locations. A glossary, resources section, and index complete the book.</p><p>David L. Hough is a longtime motorcyclist and journalist who has traveled extensively by motorcycle throughout North America and Europe. David&#x2019;s daily motorcycle commutes through city traffic for twenty-five years led him to write articles about riding skills and accident avoidance tactics. His work has appeared in numerous motorcycle publications, but he is best known for the monthly skills series Proficient Motorcycling&#x201d; in Motorcycle Consumer News, which has been honored by special awards from the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.<br><br>David has been employed professionally as a technical illustrator, photographer, and instructional graphics specialist, so it is natural that his articles are profusely illustrated by photos and drawings, all of which he creates himself.<br><br>In his spare time, David has produced the world&#x2019;s first comprehensive training system for sidecar operators.

Examining the art, the artists, their dealers and proponents, Boettger interprets Earthworks as a manifestation both of artists' personal stories and of the late 1960s social and political tumult.<br><br>Boettger overturns many commonly held notions of Earthworks' origins and intentions. She argues that Robert Smithson's work on the Dallas-Fort Worth airport stimulated his thinking and that his writing about it catalyzed the movement. The visionary environments that followed, often sculpted in expansive and remote western terrains, were idealized by Americans and Europeans alike as displays of cowboy bravado. Boettger identifies earthworkers Michael Heizer, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Morris, Walter de Maria, and Stephen Kaltenbach as former Californians whose treatment of the landscape reflects a western spirit. Her international purview integrates early work by the Europeans Barry Flanagan, Jan Dibbets, Richard Long, and Pino Pascali as precedents and parallels. Her examination of Earthworks' relationship to the ecology movement perceptively corrects a popular misconception about the artists' goals while acknowledging the social and cultural complexities of the period.<br><br>Insightful discussions of Carl Andre, Sol LeWitt, and Claes Oldenburg--in addition to the artists mentioned above--are accompanied by many rare and new photographs of both the art and its creators. Witty, accessible, and scrupulously researched, <i>Earthworks </i>constructs day-to-day chronologies of the development of the artistic movement and its intersections with the larger public events of the time, including specific accounts of galleries, exhibitions, and criticism. Boettger's dynamic social history and psychological insights bring new meaning to this pivotal movement that both embodied and disrupted contemporary notions of art, nature, society, and their relationship to each other.</p><p>"Suzaan Boettger brings alive the kaleidoscopic reality of late 1960s American culture in this elegantly written account of the radical style and ecological ambiguities of the Earthworks movement. The best book on art in the 1960s that I&#x2019;ve read in years." David Farber, author of <i>The Age of Great Dreams: America in the 1960s</i><br><br>"Given its epic intellectual scope, amazingly reader-friendly. This book will become the major source on Earthworks." Ann Gibson, author of <i>Abstract Expressionism: Other Politics</i><br><br>"Has the potential to be the definitive book on the subject." Frances Colpitt, author of <i>Abstract Art in the Late Twentieth Century</i><br><br>"A good read . . . a page turner, it brought back the flavor of the era with new historical insights made me want to go out and dig!"

It is heartbreaking to watch someone lose the very cognitive capacities that once helped to define them as a person. But because of the nature of these disorders, the only way to become an effective caregiver and cope with the role&#x2019;s many daily challenges is to become well-informed about the disease. With the right information, resources and tips on caregiving and working with professionals, you can become your own expert at both caring for your charge and taking care of yourself. <br><br>In these pages, Marc Agronin guides readers through a better understanding of the changes their loved one may be going through, and helps them tap into the various resources available to them as they embark on an uncertain caregiving journey. Insisting that a caregiver also maintain his or her own health and well being, Agronin guides caregivers in their efforts to provide care, but to also look to themselves as recipients of care from themselves and others. Shedding light on the debilitating disorders themselves as well as their everyday realities, this book is a much-needed resource for anyone caring for another person suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and other neurocognitive disorders. <br><br></p><p>Marc E. Agronin, M.D., is a board-certified adult and geriatric psychiatrist who currently serves as the Vice President for Behavioral Health and Clinical Research at the Miami Jewish Health Systems, Florida&#x2019;s largest long-term care provider. He is also an Affiliate Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. He is a graduate of Harvard University and the Yale School of Medicine, and completed his training in psychiatry at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Agronin is a nationally-recognized expert in late-life mental illness and was named the &#x201c;Clinician of the Year&#x201d; by the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry in 2008. He is a prolific author whose articles and blogs have appeared in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post, and Scientific American Mind, and his work has been featured in the New York Times, The Today Show, CNN, and National Public Radio&#x2019;s &#x201c;Talk of the Nation&#x201d; and &#x201c;On Point.&#x201d; Agronin is the author of numerous articles and books in the field of psychiatry, including the acclaimed book How We Age: A Doctor&#x2019;s Journey into the Heart of Growing Old.According to Agronin (Miami Jewish Health Systems), Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is currently the most common neurocognitive disease (NCD), and such cases are expected to quadruple worldwide within the next 50 years: surely the need for well-informed caregivers will also increase. Inspired by his long professional experience with NCD patients, Agronin offers an easy-to-understand guide for anyone who serves as a nonprofessional caregiver. An introduction briefly explains the book&#x2019;s purpose and describes requisite yet attainable characteristics of caregivers. The bulk of the material offers definitions of NCDs, including their known or suspected causes; recommended courses of action to take as a disease intensifies; and best practices for maintaining a person&#x2019;s quality of life. Equally important topics deal with respite time for the caregiver, possible legal matters, and long-term care. The final chapter is a convenient list of relevant organization names and contact information. . . . VERDICT This practical guide outlines a sensible approach to providing quality care and is therefore highly recommended for anyone who is committed to serving as a caregiver.

Author Stephen Morillo--an award-winning teacher with more than twenty-five years of experience teaching World History--frames the study of this vast subject around a model that shows students how to do world history and not just learn about it. While this globally organized text contains all of the essential information, it is the only book that does not just tell what happened, but also shows how and why it happened. Using a framework that examines networks, hierarchies, and culture in world history, Morillo presents a thesis and an argument that students--and instructors--can respond to.</p><p><br><strong>Stephen Morillo </strong>holds the Jane and Frederic M. Hadley Chair of History at Wabash College. He is the author of numerous monographs and journal articles and the coauthor of <em>War in World History: Society, Technology and War from Ancient Times to the Present</em> (2008) and <em>Cultural Encounters: Themes and</em> <em>Sources in World History</em> (2005).<br><br>"<em>Frameworks</em> provides a coherent and consistently argued frame for understanding world history on a large and connected scale, with clear conceptual attention paid to the relationship between the global and the local. The graphic representations of the relationship between networks, hierarchies, systems, and cultural frames are innovative and facilitate learning. The text provides students with a conceptual framework and scaffold whereby students will remember and understand the larger historical contexts of world history. At the same time, it provides students with the opportunity to further their historical thinking skills by challenging and substantiating the argument made in the text."--Tim Keirn, <em>California State University, Long Beach</em> <br><p></p><br>"No other text that I am aware of challenges students to think about the course of world history in terms of cultural frames, hierarchies and networks. The strength of the approach becomes clear as the book progresses. The importance of major shifts in social organization comes more clearly into focus using this method, because students are able to use a shared framework for comparison."--Eric Nelson, <em>Missouri State University</em> <br><p></p><br>"I am struck most by the innovative model and organization that drive <em>Frameworks</em>. Far too often, 'new' world history textbooks deliver mere tweaks to a distressingly standard macro-narrative and fail to devise a method to explain world history. Morillo offers a profound rethinking of an integrated interpretation of human societies. The book's greatest strength is in the development and application of hierarchies and networks as the foundational models for analysis."--Ras Michael Brown, <em>Southern Illinois University, Carbondale</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Frameworks</em> is impressive. The author's dedication to involve a global approach in every single chapter of the book is humbling--I honestly did not think that this could be done! I also appreciate the focus on historical methodology, rather than just information. This book shows a different approach-military history, social history, religious history-in every chapter. I love that it is truly interdisciplinary and that each chapter is global in scope."--Nadejda Popov, <em>University of West Georgia</em> <br><p></p><br>"It was a privilege to read this new text. <em>Frameworks</em> is truly unique. Morillo is more than a professor or a scholar; he is a teacher-author. He not only uses a tight methodology and model for examining world civilizations, but the attendant metadiscourse (metacommentary) throughout the manuscript offers students a running lesson in historical method."--Evan Ward, <em>Brigham Young University</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Rabbi&#39;s Tarot: Spiritual Secrets of the Tarot (Llewellyn&#39;s New Age Tarot Series)</h2><p>Interprets the twenty-two Major Arcana cards, and explains how the Tarot cards can be used to obtain Cosmic Consciousness</p><p>One of the most intense studies of the Major Arcana ever published.

Ian Hacking considers here some dozen case studies in the history of philosophy to show the different ways in which language has been important, and the consequences for the development of the subject. There are chapters on, among others, Hobbes, Berkeley, Russell, Ayer, Wittgenstein, Chomsky, Feyerabend and Davidson. Dr Hacking ends by speculating about the directions in which philosophy and the study of language seem likely to go. The book will provide students with a stimulating, broad survey of problems in the theory of meaning and the development of philosophy, particularly in this century. The topics treated in the philosophy of language are among the central, current concerns of philosophers, and the historical framework makes it possible to introduce concretely and intelligibly all the main theoretical issues.</p><p>Ian Hacking is a retired professor of College de France, Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts, and retired University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto. His most recent books include The Social Construction of What? (1999), An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic (Cambridge University Press, 2001), The Emergence of Probability (Cambridge University Press, 2006), Scientific Reason (2009) and Exercises in Analysis (Cambridge University Press, 2009).</p><h2>The Bataille Reader</h2><p>Since the publication in France of his <i>Oeuvres Completes</i> in the mid-1970s, the breadth of Bataille's writing and influence has become increasingly apparent across the disciplines in, for example, the fields of literature, art, art history, philosophy, critical theory, sociology, economics, and anthropology.</p><p>Since the publication in France of his <i>Oeuvres Compl�tes</i> in the mid-1970s, the breadth of Bataille's writing and influence has become increasingly apparent across the disciplines in, for example, the fields of literature, art, art history, philosophy, critical theory, sociology, economics, and anthropology. He is now held by many to be one of the most profound thinkers of the century, the enormous ramifications of whose work have yet to be fully grasped.<br> <p>In response to this growing interest, <i>The Bataille Reader</i> includes key texts from the broad spectrum of Bataille's work, from the early essays interrogating surrealism and cultural politics in the 1930s, down to texts from <i>The Accursed Share</i> (1949, translated 1988), a major engagement in post-Marxist economic theory generally regarded as being his most important work. Generous coverage is given to Bataille's speculations, also of the 1930s, on the limits of being, experience and identity, as well as to his post-war engagements with existentialism, Marxism, and Hegelianism. The major texts are interspersed with some of the brilliantly punctual essays Bataille produced throughout his career as a prolific essayist, reviewer and originator of highly-influential journals, such as <i>Documents, Acephale</i> and <i>Critique.</i> Clearly introduced and comprehensively annotated by the editors, this book provides the best single-volume coverage of Bataille's work available.</p><b>Fred Botting</b> and <b>Scott Wilson</b> both teach in the Department of English at Lancaster University.

Lincoln then turns his attention to the period when myth was recuperated as a privileged type of narrative, a process he locates in the political and cultural ferment of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, he connects renewed enthusiasm for myth to the nexus of Romanticism, nationalism, and Aryan triumphalism, particularly the quest for a language and set of stories on which nation-states could be founded.<br> <br> In the final section of this wide-ranging book, Lincoln advocates a fresh approach to the study of myth, providing varied case studies to support his view of myth&#x2014;and scholarship on myth&#x2014;as ideology in narrative form.<br></p></p><p><b>Bruce Lincoln </b>is the Caroline E.

Through this method, the authors drive students&#x2019; curiosity and inspire them to ask the &#x201c;why&#x201d; questions that get at the heart of how Accounting works. <br><br>By teaching foundational accounting concepts in a logical sequence, the Edmonds author team shifts the focus from memorizing procedures to the development of real-world thinking patterns. Author Chris Edmonds has also created a highly popular and widely used series of video lectures, which engage students by clearly and charismatically going over each learning objective in a conversational style. These videos help reinforce important lessons and are always available for review. <br><br>Through use of the financial statements model and transactional analysis, students quickly see how any given business event affects the financial statements. By having this &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; mentality, students can tie any single transaction back to the impact on the overall business. Between the straightforward writing, popular video lectures, and unique coverage approach, Fundamentals of Financial Accounting Concepts enables students to fully comprehend the material presented as future decision-makers.<br><br></p><p>Frances M.

This book provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to his life and work, revealing how his philosophical sensibility and outlook informed his interpretation of Jewish tradition.</p><p>Moshe Halbertal vividly describes Maimonides's childhood in Muslim Spain, his family's flight to North Africa to escape persecution, and their eventual resettling in Egypt. He draws on Maimonides's letters and the testimonies of his contemporaries, both Muslims and Jews, to offer new insights into his personality and the circumstances that shaped his thinking. Halbertal then turns to Maimonides's legal and philosophical work, analyzing his three great books&#x2015;<i>Commentary on the Mishnah</i>, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, and the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i>. He discusses Maimonides's battle against all attempts to personify God, his conviction that God's presence in the world is mediated through the natural order rather than through miracles, and his locating of philosophy and science at the summit of the religious life of Torah. Halbertal examines Maimonides's philosophical positions on fundamental questions such as the nature and limits of religious language, creation and nature, prophecy, providence, the problem of evil, and the meaning of the commandments.</p><p>A stunning achievement, <i>Maimonides</i> offers an unparalleled look at the life and thought of this important Jewish philosopher, scholar, and theologian.</p></p><p><p>"In the gorgeous and rugged terrain of Jewish thought, there is no higher mountain to climb than Maimonides, and no more slippery or exhilarating ascent. Halbertal has made it all the way to the top, and his survey of the whole of the Maimonidean landscape is trustworthy and masterful. This is the richest and most intellectually sophisticated book on Maimonides I have ever read."<b>--Leon Wieseltier</b></p><p>"In this learned and penetrating work, Halbertal offers us a Maimonides who draws on the dominant Greco-Islamic thought of his time while creating a system of thought that is fully Jewish. He shows us how the early <i>Commentary on the Mishnah</i> links up with the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and with the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i>, written at the end of his life, to form an unexpected and radical intellectual unity. Beautifully written, <i>Maimonides</i> brings out both Maimonides's intellectual success and the paradoxical critical approaches to him after his death."<b>--David J. Wasserstein, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>"Insightful and learned. Halbertal is perhaps the leading philosopher of Jewish law today. His book on Maimonides, like his other writings, reflects wide erudition and is written clearly and sharply."<b>--Warren Zev Harvey, professor emeritus, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</b></p><p>"Displaying the marvelous depth and clarity that mark all his work, Halbertal explains in abundant detail the transformations that Maimonides sought to effect in the Jewish world. He provides incisive interpretations of both legal and philosophical writings, yet he is also a biographer, binding together Maimonides's life, self-perception, and intellectual agenda. This is an exceptionally rich book, one that offers fresh perspectives for experts and a highly accessible introduction for general readers."<b>--David Shatz, Yeshiva University</b></p><p>"An outstanding and thrilling portrait of Maimonides.

Size D. Available.</p><p>Picasso made nearly 60 wrenching pictures of weeping women, mostly during 1937, the same year he painted Guernica , his protest against the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. On one level, these weeping women represented the victims of bombed Guernica--grieving mothers, terrified peasants, stunned survivors--on another, they stand for the anguish of Europe teetering toward world war. On yet another level, as this revelatory catalogue of a traveling exhibit demonstrates, the weeping women, with their contorted faces and macabre expressions, reflect Picasso's relationships with three women. According to Freeman, the exhibit's curator, these paintings, drawings and prints embody Picasso's vitriolic anger toward his estranged first wife Olga Koklova, his response to his compliant yet tormented mistress Marie-Therese Walter and the emotional intensity of surrealist photographer Dora Maar, who replaced Walter as his lover. This analytical study includes 100 color plates plus photographs of Picasso's three muses, who display striking physical similarities to the weeping women. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Corporations &amp; Other Business Associations: Cases &amp; Materials, Seventh Edition (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p>Sophisticated yet accessible, O Kelley/Thompson balances economic and legal theory with a flexible organization, popular case selection, and engaging problems. <p></p><p> Features:</p><ul><li> New cases on the power of shareholders to amend bylaws, an issue that is reshaping the role of shareholders in corporate governance.</li><li> A series of short case studies on key topics, including the removal of staggered boards, majority voting, and say on pay.</li><li> Discussion of the new business form the so-called benefit corporation. </li><li> The chapter on limited liability companies, which already has the most innovative treatment among major casebooks of how these entities are different from the corporate form, now includes expanded coverage of the back and forth between the Delaware courts and the Delaware legislature as to what should be the default rule as to fiduciary duty in LLCs.</li><li> A significant 2013 Court of Chancery opinion in the MFW Shareholders Litigation case, and a related 2012 Delaware Supreme Court case, Americas Mining Corp. v.

Among its many capabilities, modern Perl provides a straightforward and powerful interface to TCP/IP, and this book shows you how to leverage these capabilities to create robust, maintainable, and efficient custom client/server applications. The book quickly moves beyond the basics to focus on high-level, application programming concepts, tools, and techniques. Readers will find a review of basic networking concepts and Perl fundamentals, including Perls I/O functions, process model, and object-oriented extensions. In addition, the book examines a collection of the best third-party modules in the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, including existing network protocols f</p><p>"Network programming"--the term had a distinct meaning once, but now it begs the question, "Is there another kind?" That's why Lincoln Stein's <i>Network Programming with Perl</i> is valuable. It shows how one of the world's top Perl authorities brings the language to bear on problems that require communication among computers, showing that you may not have to resort to Java as soon as you may have thought to meet a networking requirement. What's more, Stein doesn't assume you have a lot of Perl expertise. An intermediate-level familiarity with the language should enable you to understand the examples in the book and follow its classic code-and-commentary structure.<p> Stein presents full, working scripts, calling attention to particularly interesting lines and passages by repeating them in the text. If a program makes use of an unusual or previously undiscussed function (and lots of them do, because one of the author's missions is to introduce the contents of specialized libraries), its syntax and legal parameters will be documented and a concise statement of its behavior provided. The example programs are the best part of this book, though. As the problems get more complicated, it's fun to watch Stein solve them with efficient, attractive code. Unless you're a really experienced professional, you'll be able to study the examples in this book and learn a lot. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> </p><ul><li>Perl function libraries and techniques that allow programs to interact with resources over a network </li><li>IO::Socket library </li><li>Net::FTP library </li><li>Net::Telnet library </li><li>Net::SMTP library </li><li>Chat problems </li><li>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) issues </li><li>Markup-language parsing </li><li>Internet Protocol (IP) broadcasting and multicasting</li></ul>The network is everywhere. At the office, machines are wired together into local area networks, and the local networks are interconnected via the Internet. At home, personal computers are either intermittently connected to the Internet, or, increasingly, "always-on" cable and DSL modems. New wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, promise to vastly expand the network realm, embracing everything from cell phones to kitchen appliances. Such an environment creates tremendous opportunities for innovation. Whole new classes of applications are now predicated on the availability of high-bandwidth, always-on connectivity. Interactive games allow players from around the globe to compete on virtual playing fields and the instant messaging protocols let them broadcast news of their triumphs to their friends. New peer-to-peer systems, such as Napster and Gnutella, allow people to directly exchange MP3 audio files and other types of digital content. The SETI@Home project takes advantage of idle time on the millions of personal computers around the world to search for signs of extraterrestrial life in a vast collection of cosmic noise. The ubiquity of the network allows for more earthbound applications as well. With the right knowledge, you can write a robot that will fetch and summarize prices from competitors' Web sites; a script to page you when a certain stock drops below a specified level; a program to generate daily management reports and send them off via e-mail; a server that centralizes some number-crunching task on a single high-powered machine, or alternatively distributes that task among the multiple nodes of a computer cluster. Whether you are searching for the best price on a futon or for life in a distant galaxy, you'll need to understand how network applications work in order to take full advantage of these opportunities. You'll need a working understanding of the TCP/IP protocol--the common denominator for all Internet-based communications and the most common protocol in use in local area networks as well. You'll need to know how to connect to a remote program, to exchange data with that program, and what to do when something goes wrong. To work with existing applications, such as Web servers, you'll have to understand how the application-level protocols are built on top of TCP/IP, and how to deal with common data exchange formats such as XML and MIME. This book uses the Perl programming language to illustrate how to design and implement practical network applications. Perl is an ideal language for network programming for a number of reasons. First, like the rest of the language, Perl's networking facilities were designed to make the easy things easy. It takes just two lines of code to open a network connection to a server somewhere on the Internet and send it a message. A fully capable Web server can be written in a few dozen lines of code. Second, Perl's open architecture has encouraged many talented programmers to contribute to an ever-expanding library of useful third-party modules. Many of these modules provide powerful interfaces to common network applications. For example, after loading the LWP::Simple module, a single function call allows you to fetch the contents of a remote Web page and store it in a variable. Other third-party modules provide intuitive interfaces to e-mail, FTP, net news, and a variety of network databases. Perl also provides impressive portability. Most of the applications developed in this book will run without modification on UNIX machines, Windows boxes, Macintoshes, VMS systems, and OS/2. However, the most compelling reason to choose Perl for network application development is that it allows you to fully exploit the power of TCP/IP. Perl provides you with full access to the same low-level networking calls that are available to C programs and other natively compiled languages. You can create multicast applications, implement multiplexed servers, and design peer-to-peer systems. Using Perl, you can rapidly prototype new networking applications and develop interfaces to existing ones. Should you ever need to write a networking application in C or Java, you'll be delighted to discover how much of the Perl API carries over into these languages.<p>This Book's Audience Network Programming with Perl is written for novice and intermediate Perl programmers. I assume you know the basics of Perl programming, including how to write loops, how to construct if-else statements, how to write regular expression pattern matches, the concept of the automatic $_ variable, and the basics of arrays and hashes. You should have access to a Perl interpreter and some experience writing, running, and debugging scripts. Just as important, you should have access to a computer that is connected both to a local area network and to the Internet! Although the recipes in Chapter 10 on setting Perl-based network servers to start automatically when a machine is booted do require superuser (administrative) access, none of the other examples require privileged access to a machine.</p><p>This book does take advantage of the object-oriented features in Perl version 5 and higher, but most chapters do not assume a deep knowledge of this system. Chapter 1 addresses all the details you will need as a casual user of Perl objects.</p><p>This book is a thorough review of the TCP/IP protocol at the lowest level, or a guide to installing and configuring network hubs, routers, and name servers. Many good books on the mechanics of the TCP/IP protocol and network administration are listed in the references in Appendix D. Roadmap This book is organized into four main parts, Basics, Developing Cients for Common Services, Developing TCP Client/Server Systems, and Advanced Topics. Part I, Basics, introduces the fundamentals of TCP/IP network communications.</p><p>Chapters 1 and 2, Networking Basics and Processes, Pipes, and Signals, review Perl's functions and variables for input and output, discuss the exceptions that can occur during I/O operations, and use the piped filehandle as the basis for introducing sockets. These chapters also review Perl's process model, including signals and forking, and introduce Perl's object-oriented extensions. Chapter 3, Introduction to Berkeley Sockets, discusses the basics of Internet networking and describes IP addresses, network ports, and the principles of client/server applications. It then turns to the Berkeley Socket API, which provides the programmer's interface to TCP/IP. Chapters 4 and 5, The TCP Protocol and The IO::Socket API and Simple TCP Applications, show the basics of TCP, the networking protocol that provides reliable stream-oriented communications. These chapters demonstrate how to create client and server applications and then introduce examples that show the power of technique as well as some common roadblocks.</p><p>Part II, Developing Clients for Common Services, looks at a collection of the best third-party modules that developers have contributed to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).</p><p>Chapter 6, FTP and Telnet, introduces modules that provide access to the FTP file-sharing service, as well as to the flexible Net::Telnet module which allows you to create clients to access all sorts of network services. E-mail is still the dominant application on the Internet, and Chapter 7, SMTP: Sending Mail, introduces half of the equation. This chapter shows you how to create e-mail messages on the fly, including binary attachments, and send them to their destinations. Chapter 8, POP, IMAP, and NNTP: Processing Mail and Netnews, covers the other half of e-mail, explaining modules that make it possible to receive mail from mail drop systems and process their contents, including binary attachments. Chapter 9, Web Clients, discusses the LWP module, which provides everything you need to talk to Web servers, download and process HTML documents, and parse XML.</p><p>Part III, Developing TCP Client/Server Systems--the longest part of the book--discusses the alternatives for designing TCP-based client/server systems. The major example used in these chapters is an interactive psychotherapist server, based on Joseph Weizenbaum's classic Eliza program.</p><p>Chapter 10, Forking Servers and the inetd Daemon, covers the common type of TCP server that forks a new process to handle each incoming connection. This chapter also covers the UNIX and Windows inetd daemons, which allow programs not specifically designed for networking to act as servers. Chapter 11, Multithreaded Applications, explains Perl's experimental multithreaded API, and shows how it can greatly simplify the design of TCP clients and servers. Chapters 12 and 13, Multiplexed Operations and Nonblocking I/O, discuss the select() call, which enables an application to process multiple I/O streams concurrently without using multiprocessing or multithreading. Chapter 14, Bulletproofing Servers, discusses techniques for enhancing the reliability and maintainability of network servers. Among the topics are logging, signal handling, and exceptions, as well as the important topic of network security. Chapter 15, Preforking and Prethreading, presents the forki</p></p><h2>Marine Rifleman: Forty-Three Years in the Corps</h2><p>Intrigued by the mystique and challenge of the Marine Corps, eighteen-year-old Wesley Fox enlisted in the summer of 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. He saw action with the First Marine Division in Korea and was wounded in 1951. After Korea, Fox advanced steadily in the enlisted ranks, reaching the rank of first sergeant, and, early in the Vietnam War, he received an appointment as second lieutenant. While serving as a rifle company commander with the Third Marine Division in 1969, he was twice wounded in a vicious battle during Operation Dewey Canyon. Early in this battle, every member of the company&#x2019;s command staff was either wounded or killed. In an all-or-nothing effort led by First Lieutenant Fox, his company repulsed the attack of a much larger enemy force and then counterattacked with devastating results. &#x201c;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,&#x201d; Fox received the Medal of Honor, which President Richard Nixon presented to him at the White House. Despite the personal sacrifice and frequent danger, Fox resolutely embraced the ethos of the Marine Corps, risking his life on numerous occasions and emerging as a leader in one of the most respected and feared fighting organizations in the world. Readers interested in U.S. military history from the second half of the twentieth century, in the Marine Corps, and in inspiring tales of personal achievement will find plenty of each in Fox&#x2019;s extraordinary memoir.</p><p>Col. Wesley L. Fox, USMC (Ret.), retired from the Marine Corps in 1993 after forty-three years of distinguished service. In addition to the Medal of Honor, he received two awards of the Legion of Merit, a Bronze Star with Combat V, four awards of the Purple Heart, and numerous commendations. From 1993 until his retirement in 2001, Fox served as deputy commandant of cadets at Virginia Tech. He lives in Blacksburg, Virginia.&#34;Memoirs of military men are no rarity, but few cover a life in as much remarkable detail as this one.&#34; --MILITARY HISTORY OF THE WEST</p><h2>Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction</h2><p>This book is an introduction to mathematics--in particular, it is an introduction to discrete mathematics.

As the Lewis and Clark expedition ventured into the territory of a sovereign Native nation, the Salish met the strangers with hospitality and vital provisions&nbsp;while receiving comparatively little in return.&nbsp;For the first time, a Native American community offers an in-depth examination of the events and historical significance of their encounter with the Lewis and Clark expedition. The result is a new understanding of the expedition and its place in the wider context of U.S. history. Through oral histories and other materials, Salish elders recount the details of the Salish encounter with Lewis and Clark: their difficulty communicating with the strangers through multiple interpreters and consequent misunderstanding of the expedition&#x2019;s invasionary purpose, their discussions about whether to welcome or wipe out the newcomers, their puzzlement over the black skin of the slave York, and their decision to extend traditional tribal hospitality and gifts to the guests.&nbsp;What makes <i>The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i> a startling departure from previous accounts of the Lewis and Clark expedition is how it depicts the arrival of non-Indians&#x2014;not as the beginning of history&nbsp;but as another chapter in a long tribal history. Much of this book focuses on the ancient cultural landscape and history that had already shaped the region for millennia before the arrival of Lewis and Clark. The elders begin their vivid portrait of the Salish world by sharing creation stories and their traditional cycle of life. The book then takes readers on a cultural tour of the Native trails that the expedition followed. With tribal elders as our guides, we now learn of the Salish cultural landscape that was invisible to Lewis and Clark.&nbsp;<i>The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i> also portrays with new clarity the profound upheaval of the Native world in the century before the expedition's arrival, as tribes in the region were introduced to horses, European diseases, and firearms. The arrival of Lewis and Clark marked the beginning of a heightened level of conflict and loss, and the book details the history that followed the expedition: the opening of Salish territory to the fur trade; the arrival of Jesuit missionaries; the establishment of Indian reservations, the non-Indian development of western Montana; and, more recently, the revival and strengthening of tribal sovereignty and culture.&nbsp;Conveyed by tribal recollections and richly illustrated, <i>The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition</i> not only sheds new light on the meaning of the expedition;&nbsp;it also illuminates the people who greeted Lewis and Clark&nbsp;and, despite much of what followed, thrive in their homeland today.</p><p>&#x201c;[A] remarkable and beautifully produced book. . . . It flips the standard lens of history to portray a critical American historical event from the perspective of the Salish people of western Montana. . . . Perhaps the most important reason the authors were able to write such a compelling narrative is the three decades of cultural preservation work, including extensive interviews with tribal elders that have been recorded and stored in the tribal community. This truly beautiful book is a community-based project.&#x201d;&#x2014;David R.M. Beck, <i>Oregon Historical Quarterly</i> (David R.M. Beck <i>Oregon Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It may provoke some fans of Jefferson and/or the Lewis and Clark expedition to echo the question sometimes attributed to General Custer and Little Big Horn: &#x2018;Where did all these Indians come from?&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;John Goodspeed, <i>The Star-Democrat</i> (John Goodspeed <i>The Star-Democrat</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;From Elders to authors to publishers, all stress a similar theme&#x2014;the book finally gives American Indians a chance to tell their own story.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Bulger, <i>The Missoulian</i> (Peter Bulger <i>The Missoulian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The indigenous peoples of the United States have the benefit of a recent view of history.

No one was more pleased by the book&#x2019;s reception than Baldwin&#x2019;s high school friend Sol Stein. A rising New York editor, novelist, and playwright, Stein had suggested that Baldwin do the book and coaxed his old friend through the long and sometimes agonizing process of putting the volume together and seeing it into print. Now, in this fascinating new book, Sol Stein documents the story of his intense creative partnership with Baldwin through newly uncovered letters, photos, inscriptions, and an illuminating memoir of the friendship that resulted in one of the classics of American literature. Included in this book are the two works they created together&#x2013;the story &#x201c;Dark Runner&#x201d; and the play <i>Equal in Paris</i>, both published here for the first time. <br><br>Though a world of difference separated them&#x2013;Baldwin was black and gay, living in self-imposed exile in Europe; Stein was Jewish and married, with a growing family to support&#x2013;the two men shared the same fundamental passion. Nothing mattered more to either of them than telling and writing the truth, which was not always welcome. As Stein wrote Baldwin in a long, heartfelt letter, &#x201c;You are the only friend with whom I feel comfortable about all three: heart, head, and writing.&#x201d; In this extraordinary book, Stein unfolds how that shared passion played out in the months surrounding the creation and publication of Baldwin&#x2019;s <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, in which Baldwin&#x2019;s main themes are illuminated.<br><br>A literary event published to honor the eightieth anniversary of James Baldwin&#x2019;s birth, <i>Native Sons</i> is a celebration of one of the most fruitful and influential friendships in American letters.</p><p>For over three decades, <b>Sol Stein</b> edited and published some of the leading writers of the Twentieth century, including James Baldwin, Dylan Thomas, W.

When one talks about the sixties, for example, one tends to assume that everyone knows what you're talking about, but, in fact, many of them were hardly born yet when the sixties were going on. That means you have to rethink everything as if it happened in ancient Rome or Greece.<br><br>-James Baldwin in Contact,<br><br>a publication of the University of Massachusetts<br><br>at Amherst, January-February 1984<br><br>I am remembering five thousand people crowded into the Cathedral of St. John the Divine for James Baldwin's funeral, and I imagine my lifelong friend Jimmy and me watching that event, an elbow poking the other's rib for attention as in the old days when our lives intersected.<br><br>I knew James Baldwin first in our early teenage years, when I was thirteen and he was fifteen. It all began in the tower of DeWitt Clinton High School in the north Bronx at a time when students anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City didn't need to be bused anywhere but could elect to go to a high school of their choice. Baldwin, known then and since as Jimmy, went the distance by subway, bus, and foot from Harlem in Manhattan to DeWitt Clinton at the far northern edge of New York City, an exceptional school where his last formal education took place. In this day of failed busing, it is hard to imagine that in 1939 a poor boy could travel many miles to a different borough to seize an education he could not get locally.<br><br>When DeWitt Clinton first opened the doors at its present site in May of 1929, it claimed to be the largest secondary school for boys in the world. The three-story building and its athletic field and stadium occupied about twenty-six acres and had a single-session capacity of over five thousand students. A recently remodeled room just off its library displays a picture gallery of onetime Clinton students that includes such luminaries as Paddy Chayevsky, Countee Cullen, Burt Lancaster, Ralph Lauren, Jan Peerce, Richard Rodgers, A. M. Rosenthal, Daniel Schorr, Neil Simon, and Lionel Trilling. Clinton was a garden in which black and white teenagers could become fast friends, an environment that a few years later made possible Notes of a Native Son, which in 1999 was selected by a distinguished panel as one of "the 100 best nonfiction books of the century."<br><br>Our home away from home was in what we called the Magpie Tower, the place where DeWitt Clinton's award-winning literary magazine, The Magpie, was edited by students as young as thirteen and fourteen. Our core group, besides Baldwin and me, included Richard Avedon and Emile Capouya, working under the tutelage of a faculty member, Wilmer Stone. Avedon was then a poet and shy. When we were called upon to sell the issue of January 1941, Avedon and I would stand in front of each classroom, Avedon silent, his hands clasped in front of him, while I recited a poem of his from memory. America had not yet formally entered World War II, but London was burning. Avedon's poem that lingers still in my memory is about the loss of a childhood friend in the firebombing of London. What we all wrote then is today mostly embarrassing, but the learning process was astonishing. On Friday afternoons, after classes officially let out, the Magpie gang would assemble in the tower above the three floors of the school building to hear our faculty advisor read our stories aloud to us in the most boring monotone imaginable. We were eager to see our stories in print and were learning to take criticism in a most painful way that was also instructive, for we learned then what all writers must eventually learn, that the reader has to be moved by the words alone, without help from the histrionic talents of the author.<br><br>Stone's private critiques of our work could be withering. Avedon told me a couple of years ago that on one occasion Stone asked him what kind of reading matter his parents had lying around the house. Avedon mentioned magazines like Good Housekeeping and McCall's. Stone told him, "That's what's wrong with your writing." At that moment, Avedon said, he decided to give up writing and turned, brilliantly, to photography.<br><br>More than forty years later, in the preface to the 1984 edition of Notes of a Native Son, Baldwin begins, "It was Sol Stein, high school buddy, editor, novelist, playwright, who first suggested this book. My reaction was not<br>enthusiastic: as I remember, I told him that I was too young to publish my memoirs. I had never thought of these essays as a possible book. . . . Sol's suggestion had the startling and unkind effect of causing me to realize that time had passed. It was though he had dashed cold water in my face. Sol persisted, however. . . ."<br><br>I don't remember Baldwin's resistance to doing the book. I do remember the editorial process, helped by recently finding my line-by-line editorial notes and Baldwin's responses, which are included in the correspondence section of this book. Writers can be wary of editors they don't know well. By the time Baldwin and I had to deal with Notes of a Native Son, the overlay of a friendship of a dozen years made the process easier.<br><br>A friendship that endures might reasonably be defined as a house in which disagreements are confined to an attic that can be opened for memoirs but never for continuation of a former argument. Baldwin and I came to our friendship with differences. He was black and I was white, he loved men and I loved women, he assumed his ancestors came to America in chains and I assumed my parents, who slipped over the border separately and illegally, came here because they had nowhere else to go. Despite the differences-we lived many miles apart-because of our friendship our families took a liking to each other. There are surviving photographs of Jimmy bouncing two of my pajama-clad children on his knee. I loved and admired Baldwin's mother, Berdis, and believed it was reciprocal even at our last warm meeting after Jimmy's death. Berdis visited with my family when Jimmy was abroad. I was welcome in Berdis's apartment on 131st Street in Harlem, but not by the policeman who stopped me outside and wanted to know what my white face was doing in that neighborhood.<br><br>Berdis had a secret that to my knowledge and Jimmy's say-so was never<br>divulged: the identity of Jimmy's father. The now legendary stepfather Jimmy wrote about was the preacher who married Berdis, presumably legitimized her son, and gave her eight more children. My mother, Zelda Zam, enjoyed Jimmy's brightness, his dancing hands. Like Berdis Baldwin, she had her secret. According to family legend, in the old country, hiding in the cellar during a pogrom, through a crack in the door my mother saw her first fianc� killed by one of Petlyura's Cossacks. In America she had another secret I discovered as a child during the Great Depression. In the old country, my mother at a young age was the head of secondary evening schools in Kiev, the largest city in the Ukraine. To make a living in America she sold Compton's Encyclopedia door-to-door, and one day, when the Depression bottomed, I opened the heavy sample case she took to work every day and found the knee pads she wore when cleaning other people's floors. Baldwin's mother, Berdis, may also have done the same.<br><br>Jimmy Baldwin and I, both Depression-era kids, responded differently to food. At my mother's table, Jimmy would eat like a bird, one small piece at a time, taking two hours over a simple meal, while I devoured all of it in the first few minutes. One might suppose that Jimmy was stretching out the pleasure of food, while I was gulping it down before it vanished. One of my few memories of Depression eating was the time my mother and father planted the single orange my father had brought home on the table and said, "You eat. We'll watch."<br><br>Though both of my parents came from Russia, I had trouble identifying with my mother's motherland, just as Jimmy later had trouble identifying with Africa. I remember Baldwin's rising hope in Nobody Knows My Name: "Africa was now on the stage of history. This could not but have an extraordinary effect on [the morale of blacks], for it meant that they were not merely the descendants of slaves in a white, Protestant, and puritan country: they were also related to kings and princes in an ancestral homeland, far away." Africa let Baldwin down. The dark continent produced corrupt kings and corrupt princes who robbed their people and kept them poor. Tribalism unleashed the wholesale butchery of millions, while in America, which Baldwin acknowledged as his only homeland, a black American, Colin Powell, had ascended to a position of power a few hearts away from the presidency of his country, though inner cities remained inert cities, fatherless and poor. Everything changes slowly, and human nature not at all.<br><br>Growing up, I wanted so badly to be thought of as an American and not as a sometimes despised Jew. Baldwin could instantly be seen as black by anyone. To the onlooker, I had no visible marks that at once characterized me as Jewish. Blond from birth, soon enough I was six feet tall. Observers knew me to be Jewish only after they knew my name, which left time beforehand for strangers to make anti-Semitic remarks in my presence, assuming me to be one of them. It is quicker to be typed as black, as different, as not belonging. The sting of later recognition of a Jew who doesn't look particularly Jewish can be startling.<br><br>When I was seven, in the sweltering New York summer kids could get into the swimming pool of Evander Childs High School by lining up to pay four cents for admission. One day the older boy behind me on line had a metal Star of David attached to the handlebars of his bicycle. I asked him if he was Jewish. He reared back. He didn't know the insignia he had found and affixed to his bicycle was a Jewish star. He asked if I was Jewish. I nodded, at which point he raised...</p><h2>PIC Microcontroller: An Introduction to Software &amp; Hardware Interfacing</h2><p>This book presents a thorough introduction to the Microchip PIC microcontroller family, including all of the PIC programming and interfacing for all the peripheral functions.

Budd&#39;s Labor Relations broadens the narrow process focus of existing labor relations texts by placing the discussion of contemporary U.S. processes into the context of underlying themes - what are the goals of labor relations, are those goals being fulfilled, and are reforms needed. This textbook replaces the tired paradigm of &#34;labor relations equals detailed work rules&#34; with the dynamic paradigm of &#34;labor relations equals balancing workplace goals and rights.&#34; Labor law, union organizing, bargaining, dispute resolution, and contract administration are central topics, but these processes are not presented as self-evidently good. These topics are placed in the broader context of the goals of the employment relationship, conflicting rights, and the environment of the 21st Century. This broader context serves to make labor relations more engaging and relevant to students. It also allows instructors to raise important &#34;big picture&#34; ideas while covering the applied business functions and strategies of the existing processes.</p><p>John W. Budd is a professor in the Industrial Relations Center at the University of Minnesota&#x2019;s Carlson School of Management where he holds an Industrial Relations Landgrant Professorship.

This book explores many aspects of Riemenschneider`s art and presents some fifty works representing each stage of his career, including the great altarpieces in Rothenburg on the Tauber, Creglingen, and Maidbronn.</p><p>A remarkable German sculptor, Riemenschneider produced delicate religious pieces in stone and wood from the late 15th to early 16th centuries. Time took its toll on his work, and the sculptures were broken up, destroyed, or forgotten. As part of an exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 45 of Riemenschneider's sculptures have been brought back together. This book serves not only as a catalog but also as a detailed introduction to this fine artisan and his work. Chapuis, an assistant curator in the Department of Medieval Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, along with contributing scholars and specialists, has fleshed out the artist's life, his period, and his contributions. Most interesting is the discussion of Riemenschneider's development of monochromy: rather than undertake a heavy use of paint on his pieces, he preferred to let the wood show through, contrary to the convention of the time. The full-page color pictures show every detail of the carvings.

Provides working professionals with an all-in-one source of reference to hydrogeological literature. <b></b> Brings together basic concepts from organic chemistry and microbiology to support their applications to hydrogeology and presents examples from the literature that use these concepts. The emphasis is on practical, real-world problems, with coverage of the theoretical basics but a focus on applications. <b></b> For hydrogeologists, environmental scientists, environmental specialists, soil scientists, and hydrologists. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This text is intended to serve as a practical introduction to hydrogeochemistry, especially for students who plan to work as consultants or regulators in the environmental field. Hopefully, there is enough theory to provide a foundation for understanding and applying the examples and case histories that follow and to give students the tools they need in hydrogeochemistry to begin an applied career in hydrogeology. For those instructors who prefer a more theoretical treatment of aqueous geochemistry, there are several excellent books available. </p><p> I had several goals in mind when I began this project more than five years ago. The first was to introduce and tie together the several diverse disciplines that must be brought to bear on hydrogeochemical problems today. This entailed substantial reading to replace my lack of a formal background in essential topics including organic chemistry and microbiology. I leaned heavily on several specialized books in these areas. When I began to study ground water, Freeze and Cherry's book, Groundwater, was just coming out. That book expanded my horizons tremendously into areas that were only briefly mentioned in the hydrogeology courses I had taken, among those being the chemical aspects of ground water. If this book is even a fraction as useful in illustrating the interdisciplinary aspects of this field my goals will have been met. </p><p> The second objective for writing this book was to bring to the attention of students some of the best examples and case histories from the explosion in hydrogeological literature over the past several decades. I was particularly interested in including examples with practical applications, the types of problems that professional hydrogeologists deal with on a regular basis. The text hopefully will serve as a window into this vast literature that will stimulate students to explore more deeply on their own. To those whose work I did not include because of space limitations or my lack of awareness of it, I apologize. There is so much excellent basic and applied research being done that it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep up with it all. </p><p> A number of people have been instrumental in helping me through the countless times I just wanted to give up. Bob McConnin, who took over as geology editor after the merger of Prentice Hall and Macmillan, was a pleasure to work with. Patrick Lynch has proved to be an able replacement. The reviewers, Robert G. Corbett of Illinois State University, Phil Gerla of the University of North Dakota, and Seth Rose of Georgia State University provided invaluable help in pointing out errors, inconsistencies, poor writing style, and in suggesting improvements. Several of these reviewers went well beyond the call of duty in their thoroughness. Their efforts are greatly appreciated. </p><p> Bonny True, a graduate student at Western Michigan University who took the course recently, read the entire copy-edited text and page proofs. Her careful reading caught many errors that eluded me, and I am very grateful for her help. Special thanks are due to Mick Lynch, who has allowed me to consult at his company, American Hydrogeology Inc. for the past ten years, with total flexibility in scheduling. This gave me an essential exposure to real-world problems that helped me decide what I wanted to include in a book for future hydrogeologists. I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my wife Kay and my daughter Liz, who have tolerated six years of evenings and weekends when I was working on this book or stressed out because I should have been working on it.</p><p>Alan E.

Blum, Elizabeth Hill Boone, Marcus Burke, Mitchell A. Codding, Thomas B. F. Cummins, Cristina Esteras Mart�n, M. Concepci�n Garc�a S�iz, Ilona Katzew, Adrian Locke, Gridley McKim-Smith, Alfonso Ortiz Crespo, Jorge F. Rivas P., Nuno Senos, Edward J. Sullivan, and Marjorie Trusted.<br><br> By the end of the&nbsp;16th century, Europe, Africa, and Asia were connected to North and South America via a vast network of complex trade routes. This led, in turn, to dynamic cultural exchanges between these continents and a proliferation of diverse art forms in Latin America. This monumental book transcends geographic boundaries and explores the history of the confluence of styles, materials, and techniques among Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas through the end of the colonial era&#x2013;&#x2013;a period marked by the independence movements, the formation of national states, and the rise of academic art.<br><br> Written by distinguished international scholars, essays cover a full range of topics, including city planning, iconography in painting and sculpture, East-West connections, the power of images, and the role of the artist. Beautifully illustrated with over 450 works&#x2014;many published for the first time&#x2014;this book presents a spectacular selection of decorative arts, textiles, silver, sculpture, painting, and furniture. Scholarly entries on some three hundred works highlight the various cultural influences and differences throughout this vast region. This groundbreaking book also includes an illustrated chronology, informative maps, and an exhaustive bibliography and is sure to set a new standard in the field of Latin American studies.</p><p><b>Joseph J. Rishel</b> is The Gisela and Dennis Alter Senior Curator of European Painting before 1900, Philadelphia Museum of Art. <b>Suzanne Stratton-Pruitt</b> is a scholar of Spanish and Spanish-American art of the&nbsp;17th and 18th centuries.&nbsp;<br>Even though art is the distillate of history and the embodiment of cultural exchange, the art rooted in the Iberian conquest and colonization of Latin America has received precious little consideration. This omission is now spectacularly redressed in this prodigious volume, a comprehensive and complex undertaking involving a remarkable team of international scholars. More than 450 little-known works of art spanning three centuries represent the creative output of 10 Central and South American countries, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Accompanied by trailblazing essays that address everything from city planning and architecture to mysticism, politics, and everyday life are decorative arts, textiles, silver, and furniture, as well as paintings and sculpture, vibrant, colorful, and lavishly detailed works shaped by indigenous traditions as well as the aesthetics and beliefs of Spain and Portugal, Africa and Asia. Given that religious conversion was integral to colonization, Christianity is the dominant theme, albeit passionately reimagined in fresh and diverse artistic visions. Eye-opening on many fronts, this magnificent book enhances understanding of a still sharply relevant chapter in global history. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

New expectations at school, at play, and in the workplace, however, made these menstrual traditions problematic, and middle-class women quickly sought new information and products that would make their monthly periods less disruptive to everyday life.</p><p>Lara Freidenfelds traces this cultural shift, showing how Americans reframed their thinking about menstruation. She explains how women and men collaborated with sex educators, menstrual product manufacturers, advertisers, physical education teachers, and doctors to create a modern understanding of menstruation. Excerpts from seventy-five interviews&#x2015;accounts by turns funny and moving&#x2015;help readers to identify with the experiences of the ordinary people who engineered these changes. </p><p><i>The Modern Period</i> ties historical changes in menstrual practices to a much broader argument about American popular modernity in the twentieth century. Freidenfelds explores what it meant to be modern and middle class and how those ideals were reflected in the menstrual practices and beliefs of the time. </p><p>This accessible study sheds new light on the history of popular modernity, the rise of the middle class, and the relationship of these phenomena to how Americans have cared for and managed their bodies.</p></p><p><p><b>Lara Freidenfelds</b> is a visiting lecturer in Women's Studies at Wellesley College.</p><p>"Freidenfelds argues that innovations in menstrual management would not have been possible without the expansion of middle-class values and lifestyle expectations... Recommended especially for readers in gender studies."</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"None who read this will fail to appreciate the sheer power of suggestion that marketing creates... Today's 'modern' women are more open about getting their periods, but for the less comfortable among us, the bold-faced title, <i>The Modern Period, </i>suggests a history book and thus lends itself to being read comfortably in public places with nary an old-fashioned blush."</p> (<i>Internet Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"This is the best cultural history of menstruation of twentieth-century America."</p> (<i>Museum of Menstruation and Women's Health</i>)<br><br><p>"An informative and intellectually dense treatise... incorporating resources from feminist theory, history of science, anthropology, and medicine."</p> (<i>Women's Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Modern Period</i> is a good overview that combines the major themes raised by other secondary sources with original archival and interview research. It is well written and accessible to those new to the subject. It would be suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses in medical history and gender studies."</p> (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Modern Period </i>provides a rich picture of the changing public aspects of menstruation, by mining traditional historical sources such as the medical advice literature and advertisements for Kotex and Tampax. Freidenfelds goes further, however, and lets us in on the private aspects, on the discussions between mothers and daughters, boyfriends and girlfriends, and husbands and wives... Freidenfelds' deft use of these stories augments her solid social history with the seductive lure of eavesdropping."</p> (<i>Endeavour</i>)<br><br><p>"This book adds rich, varied, and interesting dimensions to what we knew about this important subject, and it should become required reading for anyone interested in the health of twentieth-century women."</p> (Judith Walzer Leavitt <i>Journal of Social History</i>)<br><br><p>"A thorough and engaging history of menstruation... Her title, <i>The Modern Period,</i> is more than a succinct description; it cleverly references her discussion throughout of how advancing Progressive values shaped beliefs and practices surrounding menstruation. The diversity of age and ethnicity among Freidenfelds' interview participants is particularly striking and significant."</p> (<i>Social History of Medicine</i>)<br><br><p>"The Modern Period is a remarkable work... The reader learns a lot about the complex cultural history of menstrual management in the United States, which makes the book a worthy contribution to American historical and cultural studies alike."</p> (Manfred Kopp <i>Amerikastudien / American Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"Freidenfelds makes several worthy contributions to the scholarly literature. The most important of these is the rich and detailed evidence she provides about the ways in which ordinary men and women from several social groups experienced and viewed menstruation. She argues convincingly that experts and ordinary people together gave rise to the menstrual practices and beliefs that emerged and dominated in the twentieth century."</p> (Crista DeLuzio, author of <i>Female Adolescence in American Scientific Thought, 1830&#x2013;1930</i>)</p><h2>Exhaustive Concordance to the Greek New Testament, The</h2><p>For Greek students, scholars, instructors, and others whose use of the language goes beyond the rudimentary, The Exhaustive Concordance to the Greek New Testament supplies an exhaustive index to every Greek word found in the New Testament.

In this empowering book, Professor Matthew Harmon walks us through two simple sets of questions to ask every time we open our Bibles:</p><p>Understanding the Bible:<br><em>1. What do we learn about God? </em><br><em>2. What do we learn about people? </em><br><em>3. What do we learn about relating to God? </em><br><em>4. What do we learn about relating to others?</em></p><p>Applying the Bible:<br><em>1. What does God want me to understand? </em><br><em>2. What does God want me to believe? </em><br><em>3. What does God want me to desire? </em><br><em>4. What does God want me to do?</em></p><p>Arming you with practical ways to get to the heart of any passage, this book will help position you to experience the joy that results from being transformed by God&#x2019;s Word.</p></p><p><p><strong>Matthew S.

Some books on interpreting Scripture are so complicated and have so many steps that we can become discouraged, but Harmon is simple and clear without being simplistic. He helps us see the big picture in studying the Bible by reminding us of the storyline of Scripture and by emphasizing that the story centers on Jesus himself. At the same time, we are given very practical advice on how to study and apply specific passages. An excellent resource for teachers, students, and all who desire to study the Scriptures.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas R.

Larson offers practical advice for growing old with resilience and foresight. More than just canned advice, Enlightened Aging proposes a path to resilience&#x2014;one that&#x2019;s proven to help many stave off disability until very old age. The steps on this path include pro-activity, acceptance, and building and maintaining good physical, mental, and social health<br><br>Using inspiring stories from Dr. Larson&#x2019;s experiences with study participants, patients, friends, and relatives, Enlightened Aging will help readers determine what their paths can look like given their own experiences and circumstances. It informs readers of the scientific evidence behind new perspectives on aging. It inspires readers with stories of people who are approaching aging with enlightened attitudes. It offers advice and resources for readers to build their own reserves for old age. It recommends ways for readers to work with their doctors to stay as healthy as possible for their age. And it offers ideas for building better communities for our aging population. While especially relevant to the baby boom generation, this work is really for people of all ages looking for encouragement and wise counsel in order to live a long, active life.</p><p>Eric B. Larson, MD, MPH, is a leading expert in the science of healthy aging. Since 1986, he has led a large, longitudinal research program focused on delaying and preventing Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, other forms of dementia, and declines in memory and thinking. Called the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, this program is the world&#x2019;s longest-running study of its kind and includes one of the largest research populations age 85 and older. ACT is a collaboration of Group Health (a Seattle-based health system) Kaiser Permanente, the University of Washington (UW), and the National Institute on Aging. Dr. Larson is also executive director of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (formerly Group Health Research Institute), a public-interest research center. In addition, he is a clinical professor of medicine at the UW School of Medicine and of health services at the UW School of Public Health. He also maintains an internal-medicine practice, providing primary care to his patients since 1975. Before joining Group Health in 2002, Dr. Larson served as medical director for the UW Medical Center and associate dean for clinical affairs at its medical school from 1989 to 2002. He is a member and past president of the Society of General Internal Medicine; member and former chair of the Board of Regents of the American College of Physicians; a master of the American College of Physicians; and an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly called the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Larson has published hundreds of research papers in peer-review medical journals&#x2014;including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Journal of Medicine, and Annals of Internal Medicine. <br><br>Joan DeClaire is a journalist specializing in health, psychology, and family relationships. She is co-author of three books: Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child: The Heart of Parenting (1998); The Relationship Cure: A 5-Step Guide to Strengthening Your Marriage, Family, and Friendships (2002); Ten Lessons to Transform Your Marriage: America&#x2019;s Love Lab Experts Share Their Strategies for Strengthening Your Relationship (2007). DeClaire&#x2019;s work has appeared in many consumer magazines, including Readers Digest, People, Parents,Ladies&#x2019; Home Journal, and Redbook. She currently works as director of communications at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, where she edits the Healthy Findings blog, and manages media relations, social media, scientific editing, and web content development.Larson, a clinical professor of medicine, and DeClaire, a health journalist, offer an empowering exploration, targeted to baby boomers, of ways to age healthfully while staving off disability and maintaining an active life. Rather than suggesting some 'magic bullet,' the authors focus on increasing resilience, the ability to recover from setbacks and adapt to changing circumstances, through building mental, physical, and social reserves. They state that baby boomers have a better chance of aging healthfully than any generation before them, and identify factors that lead to better aging, including proactivity, attitude, and acceptance. They also caution against overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and new but not necessarily improved medication, instead lauding lifestyle changes as solutions to age-related problems. Larson and DeClaire advise readers to make decisions that are right for them and be proactive about their healthcare. Building on the subject of attitude, they recommend making aspirations more focused and attainable as one ages, something they see as leading to greater happiness and life satisfaction. Though no one can guarantee a long, healthy life, Larson and DeClaire help stack the odds in readers&#x2019; favor with their informative work. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This can-do guide gives commonsense, doable advice on how to proactively create a path to a meaningful life. Refreshingly, Larson, a physician studying how to delay and prevent Alzheimer&#x2019;s and declines in memory, promotes cost-free approaches rather than pushing particular medicines, supplements, or regimens. Instead, he recommends ways to build resilience by filling mental, physical, and social reserves. 'If you come to aging fully resourced, activated, and aware of the challenges ahead, you&#x2019;re going to have a much richer, more satisfying experience,' Larson writes. One challenge: dementia happens to one third of people aged 85 to 90 and half of those aged 90 to 95. Larson observes that employment can be an important part of identity and self-esteem, but he advises readers to make time for exercise, hobbies, and visits with loved ones, especially those connecting across generations. One 73-year-old, for example, teaches yoga every day and chauffeurs her grandsons. This thoughtful, easy-to-read book can help people of any age learn how to boost the likelihood of a long, fulfilling life.

Anyone who is planning to get old should read it. (<i>Columns: The University of Washington Alumni Magazine</i>)<br><br>Kudos to Dr. Eric B. Larson for inspiring readers to take a pro-active stance for their own health. He provides an informed approach to confronting the epidemic of over-treatment, over-diagnosis, and bad drugs older people face today.

Lipitz Center For Integrated Health Care at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health)<br><br>In Enlightened Aging Dr. Eric Larson offers a practical, positive, and humane perspective on the challenges of aging. He draws upon a rare combination of great clinical experience and in-depth knowledge of the research on aging. Dr. Larson is that caring physician who is dedicated to finding what will work best for each elderly patient. (Edward W. Campion, MD, Executive Editor, New England Journal of Medicine)<br><br>The personal, professional and the public intellectual breadth of this book is mind boggling. Even more enlivening is the heartwarming embrace we feel from Eric Larson as the son, physician, and researcher. This is a truly enlightened book by a compassionate collaborative partnership that brings the wise messages to life through stories. Taking control of your own health and building biopsychosocial resilience are the essential and wise takeaways from which we can all benefit. Nothing less fundamental than enriching your story of your life (and death) is at the core of this book. (Peter Whitehouse, MD, PhD, Professor of Neurology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine)<br><br>We all share the same two goals for our personal end game&#x2014;a long life and one that preserves our vitality until the end. Yet, information on how to achieve those goals is cluttered, confusing, and replete with overhyped promises. Enlightened Aging cuts through the clutter and offers sound, evidence-based advice from a wise physician and geriatrician. He offers no magic bullets, but does present a wealth of common sense that will help you and your loved ones face the inevitable medical, social, and economic choices that come with aging. Spoiler alert: continued physical activity is the next best thing to that elusive magic bullet. (Steven A. Schroeder, MD, Distinguished Professor of Health and Healthcare, University of California, San Francisco; Former President and CEO&#x2015;the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation)<br><br>Keep moving, learning, connecting.

Fineberg, MD, PhD, President, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation)<br><br>Enlightened Aging distills and explains 30 years of gerontology about human aging into a wonderfully readable guide for anyone looking to make the kind of choices that lead to one to age well and happily. By peppering the science with stories about his patients, Dr. Larson spins an engaging narrative that should inspire every reader.

It is well-written, thorough, and engaging."</p><h2>The Magical State: Nature, Money, and Modernity in Venezuela</h2><p><p>In 1935, after the death of dictator General Juan Vicente G�mez, Venezuela consolidated its position as the world's major oil exporter and began to establish what today is South America's longest-lasting democratic regime. Endowed with the power of state oil wealth, successive presidents appeared as transcendent figures who could magically transform Venezuela into a modern nation. During the 1974-78 oil boom, dazzling development projects promised finally to effect this transformation. Yet now the state must struggle to appease its foreign creditors, counter a declining economy, and contain a discontented citizenry. In critical dialogue with contemporary social theory, Fernando Coronil examines key transformations in Venezuela's polity, culture, and economy, recasting theories of development and highlighting the relevance of these processes for other postcolonial nations. The result is a timely and compelling historical ethnography of political power at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary reflections on modernity and the state.<br> <br></p></p><p></p><h2>Helping Yourself with Selected Prayers, Vol. 2</h2><p>Now With 170 Prayers! The prayers from Volume 2 come from diverse sources. Most originated in Roman Catholicism and can still be found in one form or another on the reverse of little pocket pictures of saints, or in collections of popular prayers. Another source for these prayers is the French Spiritist movement begun in the 1800&#x2019;s by Allan Kardec, which has become a force in Latin America under the name Espiritismo. The third source, representing perhaps the most mystical, magical, and practical aspects of these prayers, is found among the indigenous populations where Santer�a has taken root. <p>These prayers will provide a foundation upon which you can build your faith and beliefs. It is through this faith that your prayers will be fulfilled. The devotions within these pages will help you pray consciously, vigorously, sincerely and honestly.

He has lived, breathed, and contemplated photographs for the past three decades and is among the small number of critics and writers whose knowledge of art, technique, and history (not to mention linguistics, mathematics, poetry, and philosophy) has enabled him to transcend the typical blather that surrounds photographs and get to the emotional, technical, and esthetic core of genius at work. In these seven essays, revised, rewritten, and expanded from his lectures, he presents his thoughts on a some of his favorite subjects: Weston, Stieglitz, Kert�sz, Brassa�, and Strand. His knowledge is such (often enriched by first-hand acquaintance) that he can, and does, discuss more than images or personalities; he understands what informs the work, from what milieu it derives, under what in?uences it matured, how it evolved, and how it succeeded. He is an art historian willing to venture far beyond the periphery of traditional academic fences; to discuss game theory (quite literally), the mathematics of G. H. Hardy, the poetry of Rimbaud, Val�ry, Rilke, and Goethe, the philosophy of Nietzsche, the extravagance of Henry Miller.<br><br>Not since Szarkowsky s Looking at Photographs has so much singular and informed intelligence been brought to bear on this most recent of the fine arts. This is not so much a book of art criticism as a journey of philosophical inquiry. It is a text that completely understands the limitations, and potential glories, of the form within its wider context, celebrating the march of individual genius that has slowly, but inexorably, transformed a technical curiosity into an accepted art.</p><p>David Travis is Curator of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago where he has directed photography programs and acquisitions since 1972.In this enlivening suite of precise and thoughtful essays, Travis, curator of photography at the Art Institute of Chicago, conducts a unique and ardent inquiry. He explores "lived experience as a source of visual ideas" by considering the personal context within which specific photographs are made, reporting, for instance, on the revelations granted by his conversations with Brassai and scrutiny of the photographer's heavily marked books. Travis, who often quotes poetry, including that of Gary Snyder (the title is his) and Wallace Stevens, is intrigued with the "third period" of an artist's life, and offers thrillingly fresh analysis of late work by Edward Weston and Alfred Stieglitz. Travis also seeks to discern how exactly the artist transcends the mechanical point-and-shoot aspect of photography. And, most strikingly, he seeks new metaphors for understanding the power of images in mathematics, discussing Garry Winograd's gift for discovering "situational primes" and the way Henri Cartier-Bresson's photographs are "like a set geometric trap" into which the photographer adds "the dimension of incidence." This is cogent and adventurous thinking. A true intellectual pleasure. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And they become friends. But as they grow ever closer, Mrs. Jones begins to realize just how powerful Insel&#x2019;s hold over her is. <br><br>Unpublished during Loy&#x2019;s lifetime, <i>Insel</i>&#x2014;which is loosely based on her friendship with the painter Richard Oelze&#x2014;is a supremely surrealist, deliberately excessive creation: baroque in style, yet full of deft comedy and sympathy. Now, with an alternate ending only recently unearthed in the Loy archives, <i>Insel</i> is finally back in print, and Loy&#x2019;s extraordinary achievement can be appreciated by a new generation of readers.</p><p><b>Mina Loy (1882&#x2013;1966)</b> was born Mina Gertrude Lowy in London to a Hungarian father and an English mother. Originally trained as a painter, she was at the center of all the great artistic movements of the first half of the twentieth century: she wrote Futurist manifestos in Italy (including the &#x201c;Feminist Manifesto,&#x201d; which denounced the misogyny and incipient fascist tendencies of Futurism); her poem &#x201c;Brancusi&#x2019;s Golden Bird&#x201d; appeared alongside T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Waste Land&#x201d; in <i>The Dial</i>; she starred in plays in Greenwich Village in the 1920s with William Carlos Williams; she was friends with Duchamp and Man Ray; she ran a lampshade business with Peggy Guggenheim; and in the 1940s, she lived on the Bowery, where she collected trash for found-art collages, as in the style of her friend Joseph Cornell, whose work she championed. During one of her earlier stints in New York, she met the love of her life, Arthur Cravan, the Dadaist poet and boxer who disappeared in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. Only two collections of her work were published in her lifetime, <i>Lunar Baedecker </i>(1923) and <i>Lunar Baedecker and the Time Tables </i>(1958).

Articles containing tips and tricks on how to get organized cover magazine pages and pop up in TV programs and commercials, while clutter professionals and specialists referred to as &#x201c;clutterologists&#x201d; are just a phone call away. Everywhere the sentiment is the same: clutter is bad.<br> <br> In <i>The Hoarders</i>, Scott Herring provides an in-depth examination of how modern hoarders came into being, from their onset in the late 1930s to the present day. He finds that both the idea of organization and the role of the clutterologist are deeply ingrained in our culture, and that there is a fine line between clutter and deviance in America. Herring introduces us to Jill, whose countertops are piled high with decaying food and whose cabinets are overrun with purchases, while the fly strips hanging from her ceiling are arguably more fly than strip. When Jill spots a decomposing pumpkin about to be jettisoned, she stops, seeing in the rotting, squalid vegetable a special treasure. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen one quite like this before,&#x201d; she says, and looks to see if any seeds remain. It is from moments like these that Herring builds his questions: What counts as an acceptable material life&#x2014;and who decides? Is hoarding some sort of inherent deviation of the mind, or a recent historical phenomenon grounded in changing material cultures? Herring opts for the latter, explaining that hoarders attract attention not because they are mentally ill but because they challenge normal modes of material relations. Piled high with detailed and, at times, disturbing descriptions of uncleanliness, <i>The Hoarders</i> delivers a sweeping and fascinating history of hoarding that will cause us all to reconsider how we view these accumulators of clutter.</p></p><p><b>Scott Herring</b> is associate professor in the Department of English at Indiana University. He is the author of <i>Another Country: Queer Anti-Urbanism</i> and <i>Queering the Underworld: Slumming, Literature, and the Undoing of Lesbian and Gay History</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This well-argued study of so-called hoarders and their relationship with modern material culture asks for a second opinion on the recent identification of &#x2018;hoarding disorder&#x2019; in the DSM-5 as a type of psychopathology. . . . Herring digests a considerable amount of sociological, psychological, and scientific research into an engrossing and accessible exploration.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What do hoarders reveal by their unwillingness to part with things? Why is the nation currently fixated on eradicating their clutter? Drawing by turns on psychiatric debate, cultural lore, and family history, Herring&#x2019;s sharp and insightful book does not disappoint.&#x201d; (Christopher Lane, author of Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness)<br><br>&#x201c;Anxious you may be stockpiling too much stuff? No worries: Scott Herring&#x2019;s seriously smart book turns the tables on experts who have declared accumulating &#x2018;junk&#x2019; a mental illness. Putting the pack rat back into historical context, this intelligent and humane book examines how precisely disorder became a disorder. From the rise of antiquing, through the gospel of cleanliness, and all the way to reality television, Herring&#x2019;s culturally informed and deeply sympathetic readings of America&#x2019;s celebrity hoarders (the Collyer brothers, Andy Warhol, Big Edie Beale) succeed in nothing less than de-stigmatizing our own domestic caches of everyday things. Add this one to your household collection: it&#x2019;s a keeper.&#x201d; (Diana Fuss, author of The Sense of an Interior)<br><br>&#x201c;Herring&#x2019;s argument, like most books written by professors in defense of things thought to be deplored by upstanding people, can be accused of slumming. . . . Still, he has a point. It is hard to understand why, all of a sudden, in the nineteen-nineties, we started seeing houses that were inundated with rat droppings and old newspapers. Maybe he&#x2019;s wrong. Maybe the war between hoarding and anti-hoarding isn&#x2019;t a struggle between individualists and conformists. But, if not, then what is it?&#x201d; (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Using a fascinating array of sources, Herring places the contemporary obsession with hoarding within an intricate cultural and historical matrix. His innovative and ingenious work shows how hoarding became a mental disorder through the efforts of an unusual variety of groups encompassing not just psychiatrists, social workers, and other mental health professionals but also sanitation authorities, closet organizers, and TV producers.&nbsp; In the tradition of Emile Durkheim, Mary Douglas, and Michel Foucault, <i>The Hoarders</i>&nbsp;is a worthy addition to the literature on social boundaries and moral order. It reformulates our conceptions not just of hoarding but of psychiatric disorder itself.&#x201d; (Allan V. Horwitz <i>Rutgers University</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;</i><i>The Hoarders</i> tackles the contemporary medicalization of &#x2018;hoarding&#x2019; as a psychiatric disorder. Taking aim at the reification of hoarding disorder by doctors and professional organizers, this is a book less for psychiatrists than for those interested in the idea of hoarding in American culture. . . . Maybe Herring is right: We should leave hoarders alone rather than reprogram them with drugs&#x2014;or is it only the rich who have the right to destroy themselves through accumulation?&#x201d; (<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Drawing on insights gleaned from material culture studies, thing theory, cultural geography, queer studies, and disability studies, Herring focuses on contem�porary discourses of material deviance: how it is today that things&#x2014;certain things, such as rubbish and dirt&#x2014;so unsettle us, and why this unsettling has been medicalized as a dis�ease. . . . All of the hoard�ers discussed in this book challenged modern notions of how to collect and organize things, and which things matter. Making hoarding a disease, Herring explains, shows how the flu�id meaning of <i>things </i>has been codified and pathologized as psychiatry has increasingly be�come a means of social control.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For Herring, whose sole task has been to critique the modern psychopathology of material life, this oppositional logic extends beyond the Beales. In a lyrical conclusion, he advocates on behalf of all hoarders who similarly don&#x2019;t want to be fixed. Given the rigorous case that he&#x2019;s mounted across <i>The Hoarders</i>, it&#x2019;s hard to argue otherwise. One hopes that medical humanities scholars sharing Herring&#x2019;s position will read and build upon his arguments, that empiricists hewing to the <i>DSM-5</i>&#x2019;s diagnostic criteria will supplement and challenge his claims, and that hoarders will learn the history of those individuals who framed their identity.&#x201d; (<i>Literature and Medicine</i>)</p><h2>Lew Hunter&#39;s Screenwriting 434: The Industry&#39;s Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay</h2><p>For decades, Lew Hunter&#39;s Screenwriting 434 class at UCLA has been the premier screenwriting course, launching a generation of the industry&#39;s most frequently produced writers.

Give up? OK, the answer is: NOTHING!</p><p>Yes, little things that relate to the form&#x2014;and one piece of craft I am going to tell you about in this new introduction&#x2014;but in the total overall, I repeat, nothing, without caps so I don&#x2019;t get too pushy. Gertrude Stein wrote, &#x201c;A rose is a rose is a rose&#x201d;; I write, &#x201c;A story is a story is a story.&#x201d; We professors are charged by academia and our institutions, UCLA in my case, to &#x201c;break new ground,&#x201d; &#x201c;conquer new horizons,&#x201d; clich�s that relate more to horticulture or astronomy than screenwriting. Every time someone tries something new, it seems as if they end up making a divertissement for the mirror, for the shelf in a lab or, if they are lucky, something direct-to-video/DVD.</p><p>Geoff Gilmore, co-director of that wonder of modern film wonders, The Sundance Film Festival, told me they screen more 1200 feature length films each year and pick about sixty for this seminal American event. The Utah hills are alive with the sound of film music and dialogue but the lab and video shelves groan with the work of those filmmakers who eschew Aristotle&#x2019;s staple of storytelling structure: a beginning, middle, and end. Aristotle did not give us a &#x201c;formula&#x201d; in the pejorative sense of that word, but it is a formula that echoes the biological rhythm of The Audience. I cite Aristotle because I still consider his <i>Poetics</i> to be one of the two bibles for performance drama/comedy.</p><p>The second Holy Treatise is Lajos Egri&#x2019;s <i>The Art Of Dramatic Writing.</i> You see, Aristotle did not get much into character as character was devalued in his day. Dramatists as often as not literally covered the actors&#x2019; faces with masks, hence the origins of the symbol for drama, the masks of comedy and tragedy. The Greek plays were much about gods and goddesses, not quasi-ordinary people such as you and I. And the amphitheaters in which these dramas were staged were not the intimate theaters of today or the big screen that reveals every pout and pore. It wasn&#x2019;t until the late 1800s when Strindberg and Ibsen, later to be joined by the likes of Eugene O&#x2019;Neil, offered up those &#x201c;slice of life&#x201d; or &#x201c;kitchen sink&#x201d; plays in which character was king.</p><p>Enter Lajos Egri, a somewhat failed playwright/screenwriter who distilled his independent teachings into a marvelous essay on &#x201c;character&#x201d; in <i>The Art of Dramatic Writing</i>. Of course, in my own teaching and writing, I go on and on about Ari and Egri. And, here in this Redux, I am reinforcing the point that it still doesn&#x2019;t get better than those two cats. If you are grounded in the <i>Poetics</i> and the character dictates of <i>The Art Of Dramatic Writing,</i> you have the bedrock information. Forget Walter, Seger, Field, McKee, Hague, Downs/Russin, Goldman, Hunter, et al. But, by all means read the self- and publicly acclaimed screenwriting gurus. Our volumes have become like recipe books&#x2014;recipes to help you build your own personal internal screenwriting structure. When you couple that knowledge with your individual creativity, voila, you become a screenwriter!</p><p>Although I still believe that &#x201c;nothing is new under the sun,&#x201d; in spite of Ecclesiastes there is a unique element that infuses every screenplay ... if you let it. <i>You</i> are what&#x2019;s new under the sun. As part of my research for a forthcoming book in which Academy Award-winning screenwriters bare their art, craft, and secrets, I asked Bill Goldman how he writes a screenplay. Bill erupted with: &#x201c;Oh God, the horror of it all is that we each do it so differently.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; I protested. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the glory of it all. I want it to show that writers don&#x2019;t have to be as good as Bill Goldman. They have to be as good as themselves. Their own uniqueness is the key here. I can&#x2019;t be as good as you. Ergo, can you be as good as me?&#x201d;</p><p>To prepare for this reissue of <i>Lew Hunter&#x2019;s Screenwriting 434,</i> I reread the whole book with the idea of a somewhat gentle updating&#x2014;maybe some new thoughts or anecdotes, or examples. About halfway through, my memory flashed on Aristotle and Egri and how the syllabus I devised in 1979 for my original Screenplay 434 graduate class at UCLA, is still intact with Ari and Egri as its centerpiece. Getting students back to Aristotle and Egri was my real teaching job because superior storytelling has not changed since the time of the cave people to which I refer in Chapter One. Some of my rich and famous ex-students have come back for a &#x201c;434&#x201d; fix and I often catch them lip-syncing to my dialogue: Stay with the basics. Stay with the bedrock of yesteryear&#x2019;s seminal storytellers. Stay with E Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s last line in <i>The Great Gatsby:</i> &#x201c;And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&#x201d;</p><p>Now, going into the second half of rereading <i>434,</i> I am still concerned about putting in new stuff. When I wrote the book, my intention was to make it as timeless as Ari or Egri. Both maintain the authority of a true sense of validity I think is still paramount in screenwriting knowledge/education.</p><p>My appreciation for Ari and Egri is constant. I consciously tried for two things. First, I wanted to make the book on-the-money for basics and second, to really show how ninety percent of working screenwriters develop scripts. I want to give a boy on a bayou pier in Louisiana or a young woman in a fire station tower in Montana access to professional writing even if they had no other book except <i>Screenwriting 434.</i> To do so would mean that I have to use timeless examples and not pick &#x201c;flavor of the month&#x201d; movies or screenwriting tricks.</p><p>I also tried to stay away from assaulting readers with a blizzard of film references to carry out my pedagogy so I insist that readers needs to know only five movies intimately, four of which are timeless classics.</p><p>And I wanted to write a &#x201c;How-To ... &#x201d; book. Unashamedly. In Southern California, this concept would be called a &#x201c;process&#x201d; book. In Nebraska, we call it a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; book. At the time of the original publication of <i>Screenwriting 434,</i> none of the books available told the readers <i>how</i> to write a screenplay. They talk <i>about</i> writing a screenplay, around it, and give copious examples, but none&#x2014;even to this day&#x2014;actually take the reader through the steps that ninety percent of my fellow Writers Guild Of America members utilize.</p><p>I again hit the memory bank: Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. <i>(Hud, Norma Rae)</i> were having a turn in one of my 434 classes. Some grad student, surely on his twentieth draft of a current love/hate child, eagerly asked about rewriting. He leaned forward as if pleading for empathy with his own struggle. Irving referred with his eyes to Harriet for what appeared to be her approval to speak for both of them. Her nod prompted Irving to reply, &#x201c;We like to get it right the first time.&#x201d;</p><p>After my second rereading of <i>Screenwriting 434,</i> I questioned whether I had gotten it right the first time. Well, for me, the answer was yes. I teach the same basics that I always have. I still try to take the mystery out of screenwriting. I still ask students for the raison d&#x2019;etre of the work&#x2014;the &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it about?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll still do anything to get good scripts out of anyone. But, there is one piece of craft I have added to my professing, of late.</p><p>When I am teaching in Europe, people ask me when I&#x2019;m going to start showing them &#x201c;the Hollywood way&#x201d;. They question my reference to and reverence for Aristotle and Egri and European films as examples? Surprising, this has not caused me to look west for new material, but to add a layer to the process that that is also as far away from their expectations as Camus. But not Camus, Campbell.</p><p>In his landmark <i>Hero With a Thousand Faces,</i> Joseph Campbell espouses that legendary heroes (or heroines) take a three-part journey in their stories: 1. The hero <i>hears</i> the call to adventure. 2. The hero <i>accepts</i> the call to adventure. 3. The hero gives him up for the greater good.</p><p>Certainly, the hero hearing &#x201c;the call to adventure&#x201d; correlates exactly with my description of what constitutes the end of the first act&#x2014;the &#x201c;floating page 17&#x201d; for those of you who have taken my 434 route. And though the hero giving himself up for the greater good certainly holds true in <i>Casablanca,</i> other watershed movies don&#x2019;t always follow this course. However, it is the second point in the Campbell paradigm that really works for me in all classic celluloid tales. The hero accepting the call to adventure is a concept that I had not embraced when I wrote <i>Screenwriting 434.</i> The second part of the journey as defined by Mr. Campbell seemed exactly right in describing that moment in seminal film stories when the hero stops being a reactor and actively now takes part in the movie to it&#x2019;s tragic/bittersweet/fulfilling/happy ending. And this heroic decision occurs near the precise center of our most memorable movies&#x2014;a &#x201c;floating page 60.&#x201d; In <i>Casablanca</i> Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) decides to use the letters of transit. The audience hopes that it is to get passage for him and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Or in <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,</i> our heros literally depart for Bolivia. Or, the children in <i>E.T.</i> decide to get E.T. home. Or, with his fallen comrade in his arms, Forrest Gump dedicates his life to Bubba.</p><p>Steven Spielberg and I were once mutually expressing admiration for screenwriter Diane Thomas <i>(Romancing The Stone).</i> Steven said that Diane would always say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the second act. Lemme fix the second act.&#x201d; And it is a fact: Nearly all troubled scripts have the most problems in Act Two. I believe those problems stem from the writer having a <i>reactive</i> hero predominately or totally throughout. The audience wants the hero to say, &#x201c;Dammit, I&#x2019;m going to get Pauline off that railroad track!&#x201d;</p><p>So there you are, gentle reader, my single addition to <i>Lew Hunter&#x2019;s Screenwriting 434.</i> I could go on about the &#x201c;center point&#x201d; but it would only be elaboration and in my professings, I periodically try to follow my edict for good dialogue&#x2014;less is more&#x2014;which I shall do in this redux.</p><p>So, we&#x2019;ll happily keep riding the screenwriting wave. Have we crested? Will the swell build any more? I believe as long as there are dreams, your dreams&#x2014;and we know who you are&#x2014;the answer can only be a thundering YES!</p><p><b>FADE IN</b></p><p>I have been teaching the 434 graduate screenwriting classes at UCLA since 1979. Prior to then, I guest lectured at universities across the contiguous United States. Since then, I have molested creative minds with workshops and lectures in Israel, England, China, South America, France, Australia, and oh, literally, around the world. In every university, the cry is consistent. &#x201c;Our weakest link is writing.&#x201d; Not so at UCLA. Why? Let me speak just for myself.</p><p>My personal teaching bent is not to dispense excessive theory or hypothetical situations and exercises in screenwriting. I like to get with a small group of well-educated, highly motivated people, roll up our figurative sleeves, and start developing screenplays, from idea through story and script to notes for the rewrite. At the end of that creative tunnel is an original creation: a script that will develop that person&#x2019;s potential many steps closer to being the finest writer he or she can be. Not a &#x201c;Hollywood&#x201d; writer but a writer who can apply quality talent to any possible screen around the globe. From Hollywood to Nairobi. From TV to esoteric video experiments.</p><p>Out of my lectures and writings have come many thoughts and passions about screenwriting. Some from fellow writers, some from me, some from...</p></p><h2>Bedouin Culture in the Bible</h2><p><b>The first contemporary analysis of Bedouin and biblical cultures sheds new light on biblical laws, practices, and Bedouin history</b><br><br> Written by one of the world&#x2019;s leading scholars of Bedouin culture, this groundbreaking book sheds new light on significant points of convergence between Bedouin and early Israelite cultures, as manifested in the Hebrew Bible.

But roaming the planet are four times as many dogs who are their own masters&#x2014;neighborhood dogs, dump dogs, mountain dogs. They are dogs, not companions, and these dogs, like pigeons or squirrels, are highly adapted scavengers who have evolved to fit particular niches in the vicinity of humans. In <i>What Is a Dog? </i>experts on dog behavior Raymond and Lorna Coppinger present an eye-opening analysis of the evolution and adaptations of these unleashed dogs and what they can reveal about the species as a whole.<br><br> Exploring the natural history of these animals, the Coppingers explain how the village dogs of Vietnam, India, Africa, and Mexico are strikingly similar. These feral dogs, argue the Coppingers, are in fact the truly archetypal dogs, nearly uniform in size and shape and incredibly self-sufficient. Drawing on nearly five decades of research, they show how dogs actually domesticated themselves in order to become such efficient scavengers of human refuse. The Coppingers also examine the behavioral characteristics that enable dogs to live successfully and to reproduce, unconstrained by humans, in environments that we ordinarily do not think of as dog friendly.<br><br> Providing a fascinating exploration of what it actually means&#x2014;genetically and behaviorally&#x2014;to be a dog, <i>What Is a Dog?</i> will undoubtedly change the way any beagle or bulldog owner will reflect on their four-legged friend.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Raymond Coppinger</b> is professor emeritus of biology at Hampshire College. <b>Lorna Coppinger</b> is a biologist and science writer. Their books together include<i> Dogs: A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution, </i>also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;There are about a billion dogs on Earth, according to some estimates. The other 750 million don&#x2019;t have flea collars. And they certainly don&#x2019;t have humans who take them for walks and pick up their feces. They are called village dogs, street dogs and free-breeding dogs, among other things, and they haunt the garbage dumps and neighborhoods of most of the world. In their new book, <i>What Is a Dog</i>?, Raymond and Lorna Coppinger argue that if you really want to understand the nature of dogs, you need to know these other animals. The vast majority are not strays or lost pets, the Coppingers say, but rather superbly adapted scavengers&#x2014;the closest living things to the dogs that first emerged thousands of years ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The dog is a shape that has evolved to a new niche that was created when people switched from hunting and gathering to growing grain. The waste products of that activity created a food supply that supports village dogs. So, according to the Coppingers, a dog is a kind of canid that has evolved to co-exist with humans &#x2014; as a pet, a worker or a scavenger (or, in some cases, a combination of all three). Once they&#x2019;ve spelt it out, it all seems fairly obvious. However, I never thought it through before, and now I see dogs in an entirely different light. Far from being a shameless stooge, <i>Canis familiaris </i>is actually a highly sophisticated scrounger. Seems man&#x2019;s best friend is a lot smarter than we all imagined.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Spectator</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an informative, well-written book on the evolution of all canids, including the wild types (wolves, coyotes, jackals, and dingoes) and the ubiquitous and diverse domestic dogs. . . . Recommended.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;From their decades of research, the Coppingers have given us yet another epic book about dogs. The Coppingers take a unique and intensive look at the biology and population genetics of <i>Canis familiaris</i>, the niche that dogs occupy, and the problems that they face cohabitating with man. A must read for anyone really interested in knowing this animal that many call &#x2018;man&#x2019;s best friend&#x2019;!&#x201d; (Ken McCort, owner and operator of Four Paws training center)<br><br>&#x201c;If you thought you knew what a dog was, better check this book out. The Coppingers explore the domestic dog in relation to its wild relatives in a way only these authors can.&nbsp; You&#x2019;ll visit such places as Istanbul, Mexico City, South Africa, and Baffin Island and also learn about such non-dogs as pigeons, vultures, codfish, and hummingbirds. Didn&#x2019;t know about the dog&#x2019;s ecological niche?&nbsp; Its behavioral ecology?&nbsp; Its symbiotic relationships? The Coppingers will fill you in and forever make you more appreciative of your pet&#x2019;s complexity.&#x201d; (L. David Mech, coauthor of Wolves on the Hunt)<br><br>&#x201c;Dogs are an immensely popular subject, and hundreds of books have been written on every aspect of their biology and relationships with humans. So, it is hard to believe that anything new could be said, but this book proves that there might be much more to their science than we currently know. The Coppingers&#x2019; new book is deeply innovative, and it challenges, with remarkable clarity and compelling examples, the established &#x2018;dogmas&#x2019; of the origin of dogs and their dependence on humans. It is beautifully written and rich with original perspectives. There is no doubt that this book will force us to rethink our relationship with dogs.&#x201d; (Luigi Boitani, editor of Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>What Is a Dog?</i>, the follow-up volume to their thought-provoking 2001 book <i>Dogs: A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution</i>, biologist team Raymond and Laura Coppinger continue to turn re-evaluative insights on these deceptively familiar creatures. The question that makes up the title of their new book is by no means rhetorical. . . .The Coppingers make a convincing case that goes well beyond the standard paleolithic-man-tames-wolf-cubs scenario presented in every textbook in the world about the phylogeny of dogs.

Drawing on a vast store of archival materials, <i>The People with No Name</i> is the first book to tell this fascinating story in its full, transatlantic context. It explores how these people--whom one visitor to their Pennsylvania enclaves referred to as ''a spurious race of mortals known by the appellation Scotch-Irish''--drew upon both Old and New World experiences to adapt to staggering religious, economic, and cultural change. In remarkably crisp, lucid prose, Patrick Griffin uncovers the ways in which migrants from Ulster--and thousands like them--forged new identities and how they conceived the wider transatlantic community.</p><br><p> The book moves from a vivid depiction of Ulster and its Presbyterian community in and after the Glorious Revolution to a brilliant account of religion and identity in early modern Ireland. Griffin then deftly weaves together religion and economics in the origins of the transatlantic migration, and examines how this traumatic and enlivening experience shaped patterns of settlement and adaptation in colonial America. In the American side of his story, he breaks new critical ground for our understanding of colonial identity formation and of the place of the frontier in a larger empire. <i>The People with No Name</i> will be indispensable reading for anyone interested in transatlantic history, American Colonial history, and the history of Irish and British migration.</p></p><p><p>"A masterful reconstruction of the experiences of the Scots Irish migrants who transformed the culture of the eighteenth-century colonial frontier.

Breen, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"This is a first-rate and timely piece of scholarship, offering a compelling new vision of transatlantic history and an equally compelling analysis of the intricacies of identity and culture in the colonial Atlantic world.

Certainly, every scholar who does research in Irish and/or Scots Irish history will want to read this book, as will many specialists in immigration history.

Yet critics have argued about the precise nature of this novel, or biography, or "criticism-fiction" which is the summation of Sartre's philosophical, social, and literary thought. Sartre writes, simply, in the preface to the book: "<i>The Family Idiot</i> is the sequel to <i>The Question of Method</i>. The subject: what, at this point in time, can we know about a man? It seemed to me that this question could only be answered by studying a specific case." <br><br>"A man is never an individual," Sartre writes, "it would be more fitting to call him a universal singular. Summed up and for this reason universalized by his epoch, he in turn resumes it by reproducing himself in it as singularity. Universal by the singular universality of human history, singular by the universalizing singularity of his projects, he requires simultaneous examination from both ends." This is the method by which Sartre examines Flaubert and the society in which he existed. <br><br>Now this masterpiece is being made available in an inspired English translation that captures all the variations of Sartre's style&#x2014;from the jaunty to the ponderous&#x2014;and all the nuances of even the most difficult ideas.

Yet those meager remains showed such power and genius that they captured the imagination of readers through the ages.

As recently as 2014, yet another discovery of a missing poem created a media stir around the world.</p><p>The poems of Sappho reveal a remarkable woman who lived on the Greek island of Lesbos during the vibrant age of the birth of western science, art, and philosophy. Sappho was the daughter of an aristocratic family, a wife, a devoted mother, a lover of women, and one of the greatest writers of her own or any age. Nonetheless, although most people have heard of Sappho, the story of her lost poems and the lives of the ancient women they celebrate has never been told for a general audience.</p><p><em>Searching for Sappho</em> is the exciting tale of the rediscovery of Sappho&#x2019;s poetry and of the woman and world they reveal.</p> 14 illustrations</p><p>The author of more than a dozen books on the ancient world, Philip Freeman is a professor and chair of the classics department at Luther College.

In celebration, an updated and expanded ninth edition of this American classic reminds us once again of the value of good old-fashioned comfort food. The original Big Red Cookbook was immediately popular with a postwar audience seeking basic cooking advice and simple recipes that took advantage of several then-new convenience products. The ninth edition remains true to its roots, presenting exemplary instruction, savory mainstream dishes (that still make use of convenience foods and the products of parent company General Mills), and, most notably, standout chapters on baking and dessert specialties. New to this edition, which offers nearly 1,000 recipes, are grilling and vegetarian chapters; up-to-date nutrition information; additional color photos; and contemporary formulas for the likes of Brie with Caramelized Onions, Asiago Bread, and Tandoori Chicken with Chutney.<p> Instruction was and is the book's strongest suit, and any cook--novice to professional--will benefit from its many how-to features. These include step-by-step directions with photos, tips for kitchen timesaving, and troubleshooting advice.

Standouts among the vast recipe collection, more than 300 of which are designated fast or low fat, include old favorites such as Macaroni and Cheese, Old-Fashioned Baked Beans, and Lemon Chiffon Cake. A few newer ones, such as Sun-Dried Tomato and Olive Bread, also qualify.

Neither wholly British nor completely Indian, the young boy searches for his identity in the country where he was born; but at the same time, he struggles to create an identity for himself. Cunning and street wise, Kim is mature beyond his thirteen years and learns to move chameleon-like between the two cultures, becoming the disciple of a Tibetan monk while training as a spy for the British secret service.<br>Far above the average adventure story, Kim will captivate Kipling devotees as well as fans of tales brimming with foreign intrigue and treachery.</p><p>One of the particular pleasures of reading <i>Kim</i> is the full range of emotion, knowledge, and experience that Rudyard Kipling gives his complex hero. Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>Only Way to Learn About Tomorrow</h2><p>Volume 4: Current Patterns <p>The Only Way to Learn About Tomorrow discusses the current patterns in astrology which allow the astrologer to look forward (forecasting) as well as examine the present and the past. </p><p>The authors cover secondary progressions, solar arc direction, transits, eclipses and cycles as well and solar and lunar returns.

This pioneering book, which focuses on Salcedo&#x2019;s works from 2001 to the present, examines the development and evolution of her approach.

Mary Schneider Enriquez convincingly argues for viewing Salcedo&#x2019;s oeuvre not just through a particular theoretical lens, such as violence studies or trauma and memory studies, but for the profound way the artist engages with and expands the traditions of sculpture as a medium.&nbsp;</p><p>This compelling book focuses on Doris Salcedo&#x2019;s works from 2001 to the present, which challenge not only the limits of the materials she uses but also the traditions of sculpture itself.<br><b>Mary Schneider Enriquez</b> is the Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museums.<br></p><h2>Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law</h2><p><p>Should laws about sex and pornography be based on social conventions about what is disgusting? Should felons be required to display bumper stickers or wear T-shirts that announce their crimes? This powerful and elegantly written book, by one of America's most influential philosophers, presents a critique of the role that shame and disgust play in our individual and social lives and, in particular, in the law.</p><br><p> Martha Nussbaum argues that we should be wary of these emotions because they are associated in troubling ways with a desire to hide from our humanity, embodying an unrealistic and sometimes pathological wish to be invulnerable. Nussbaum argues that the thought-content of disgust embodies "magical ideas of contamination, and impossible aspirations to purity that are just not in line with human life as we know it." She argues that disgust should never be the basis for criminalizing an act, or play either the aggravating or the mitigating role in criminal law it currently does. She writes that we should be similarly suspicious of what she calls "primitive shame," a shame "at the very fact of human imperfection," and she is harshly critical of the role that such shame plays in certain punishments.</p><br><p> Drawing on an extraordinarily rich variety of philosophical, psychological, and historical references--from Aristotle and Freud to Nazi ideas about purity--and on legal examples as diverse as the trials of Oscar Wilde and the Martha Stewart insider trading case, this is a major work of legal and moral philosophy.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2004 Award for Best Professional/Scholarly Book in Law, Association of American Publishers<p>"This exciting book on emotions and the law tackles universal questions central to every legal system. We may pretend that law is a wholly rational discipline. We may try to tame strong emotions. But as Martha Nussbaum shows in her analysis of the passions that influence our attitude to law and its problems, we cannot deny our human feelings. Sometimes in the law, however, we strongly need to keep them in check. Intuition, in particular, is often wrong. Disgust is sometimes based on an infantile dislike of the unfamiliar."<b>--Justice Michael Kirby, High Court of Australia</b></p><p>"This elegantly written book interweaves materials from psychoanalytic theory, ancient and contemporary moral and political philosophy, literature and law. Hiding from Humanity represents a comprehensive, sustained, and highly impressive analysis of the emotions of shame and disgust and the role they play in moral and legal analysis."<b>--Seana Shiffrin, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"A pleasure to read.

Keats immortalized the work of the Renaissance dramatist and poet in the sonnet "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer." Swinburne praised the translations for their "romantic and sometimes barbaric grandeur," their "freshness, strength, and inextinguishable fire." The great critic George Saintsbury (1845-1933) wrote: "For more than two centuries they were the resort of all who, unable to read Greek, wished to know what Greek was. Chapman is far nearer Homer than any modern translator in any modern language." This volume presents the original text of Chapman's translation of the <i>Odyssey</i> (1614-15), making only a small number of modifications to punctuation and wording where they might confuse the modern reader. The editor, Allardyce Nicoll, provides an introduction, textual notes, a glossary, and a commentary. Garry Wills's preface to the <i>Odyssey</i> explores how Chapman's less strained meter lets him achieve more delicate poetic effects as compared to the <i>Iliad</i>. Wills also examines Chapman's "fine touch" in translating "the warm and human sense of comedy" in the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p><br><br><p> Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br>That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;<br>Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br>Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold.<br>--John Keats</p></p><p><p>"<i>Chapman's Homer</i> provided for the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> exactly what the <i>King James Bible</i> (also published in 1611) did for the <i>Hebrew Bible</i> and the <i>New Testament</i> in English: it offered a stylistically vigorous and morally powerful translation that has influenced generations of subsequent readers, even as new versions have proliferated."<b>--Jan M. Ziolkowski, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Chapman's versions inspired English poets for centuries after his time. They rest on a minute and perceptive reading of the texts. And they retain their power to fascinate and provoke anyone interested in Homer and his afterlife, in Renaissance ideas about classical and modern poetry, or in the development of the language of English poetry."<b>--Anthony T. Grafton, Princeton University</b></p>Immortalized by John Keats in his poem "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer," two nearly 400-year-old masterpieces of canonical translation Chapman's versions of The Iliad (re-published in 1998) and The Odyssey (coming this month) are now both available in U.S. editions for the first time since 1957. Even stalwart fans of Robert Fagles's recent triumphs will want these versions, which retain their visionary clarity and power. In the words of Keats: "Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:/ Yet did I never breathe its pure serene/ Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:/ Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken;/ Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes/ He stared at the Pacific and all his men/ Look'd at each other with a wild surmise / Silent, upon a peak in Darien." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Workplace Communications: The Basics (7th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Professional Communication and Workplace Writing.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Practical tools for communicating at work</b> </p> <p>After teaching a course to college students pursuing trade careers, George Searles realized his students needed a book focused on practical applications rather than theory&#x2013;and that explored workplace communication in a user-friendly tone. <b> <i>Workplace Communications: The Basics </i> </b>takes a down-to-earth approach to writing and communicating on the job, teaching the essentials in an accessible style appropriate for any student or course.

Aristotle&#x2019;s <i>Poetics</i> contains his treatment of Greek tragedy: its history, nature, and conventions, with details on poetic diction. Stephen Halliwell makes this seminal work newly accessible with a reliable text and a translation that is both accurate and readable. His authoritative introduction traces the work&#x2019;s debt to earlier theorists (especially Plato), its distinctive argument, and the reasons behind its enduring relevance.<br>The essay <i>On the Sublime</i>, usually attributed to &#x201c;Longinus&#x201d; (identity uncertain), was probably composed in the first century CE; its subject is the appreciation of greatness (&#x201c;the sublime&#x201d;) in writing, with analysis of illustrative passages ranging from Homer and Sappho to Plato. In this edition, Donald A. Russell has revised and newly annotated the text and translation by W. Hamilton Fyfe, and supplied a new introduction.<br>The treatise <i>On Style</i>, ascribed to an (again unidentifiable) &#x201c;Demetrius&#x201d;, was perhaps composed during the secod century BCE. It is notable particularly for its theory and analysis of four distinct styles (grand, elegant, plain, and forceful). Doreen Innes&#x2019;s fresh rendering of the work is based on the earlier Loeb translation by W. Rhys Roberts. Her new introduction and notes represent the latest scholarship.</p><p><p>Stephen Halliwell is Professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews.</p><p>Donald A.

The Loeb editors have chosen the world's best scholars on these difficult authors for the revisions... Each ancient text is given a clear, informative introduction, outlining for general readers and specialists alike the basic problems and concerns of each essay, backed up with helpful bibliographical notes...

It is a tall enough order, at the end of the twentieth century to attempt one translation of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, but Stephen Halliwell has now produced two... This new Loeb edition is, by design, noticeably closer to the Greek than Halliwell's earlier translation.

Over 800 illustrations, external parts and skeletal drawings, and new photographs offer readers a close look at each species and each livestock management technique. <b> </b>Features chapters on beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, horses, sheep, goats, poultry, livestock restraint and herd health.&nbsp;Covers all aspects of each species from breeding and conception through their complete lifecycle.<b>&nbsp;</b>Recommends techniques that are best for both the livestock manager and the animal. Provides cautionary notes at appropriate danger points with each step-by-step procedure. Follows a predictable format that includes an introduction to each technique, lists of necessary equipment, a discussion of required restraint, cautionary notes at appropriate danger points, a description of the normal recovery sequence, and a discussion of postprocedural management.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>Excellent for those involved in livestock management.</p><p>PREFACE <p> The first edition of Handbook of Livestock Management was designed to fill the need for a book that described in detail the skills and techniques needed by those who managed livestock. We, the authors and contributors to that first edition, thought it important that the teacher, student, and producer utilize sound and safe procedures in the management of farm animals, thereby maximizing animal well-being and productivity as well as enjoyment for the manager. The book was intended as a comprehensive text and reference for students of animal science, veterinary science and technology, and vocational agriculture, and as a handbook and reference for livestock producers and technicians. </p><p> Today, just as when we completed the first two editions, the need is the same&#x2014;a text, a guidebook, that provides the details of useful, complete, accurate and safe procedures for performing the absolutely necessary livestock management techniques. This book is intended to fill in the gaps between the classroom and the laboratory. The material is not theoretical; it is primarily hands-on. It describes not only what to do but how to do it. </p><p> In reality, the need for the Handbook is greater today than it was 20 years ago. There are fewer of us growing up on farms, there is a greater awareness of the need to provide for an animal's well-being, and there is less time to teach (and learn) hands-on manipulative skills because of the ever-increasing body of technical and cognitive skills that must be taught to (and learned by) our students in the classroom. </p><p> Just as in the first two editions, included in this edition of the Handbook are chapters on the management of beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, horses, sheep, goats, and poultry, along with chapters on livestock restraint and herd health. The presentation of the techniques in each chapter follows the same format. A brief introduction to each technique is presented along with a listing of necessary equipment, a discussion of required restraint, a detailed step-by-step procedure with cautionary notes at appropriate danger points, a description of the normal recovery sequence, and a discussion of necessary postprocedural management. At every opportunity, the verbal directions are supported by illustrations, of which there are over 800. </p><p> Parts of the animal, with terms accepted by livestock professionals, are included as chapter frontispieces. Labeled drawings of the skeletal structures of the various animals are presented in the appendices. A useful glossary and a comprehensive, cross-listed index complete the educational package. </p><p> No specialized knowledge is required for an understanding of the text. Many of the techniques can be self-taught. The book is written and organized in such a manner that the student can learn by doing. When it is commonly recognized that there are several ways of performing a technique, the one presented is preferred by the author and recommended as best for both the livestock manager and the animal. </p><p> The material presented in Handbook of Livestock Management reflects -the years of experience and livestock production backgrounds of the author and contributors. It is unique in its approach and in its completeness. The author hopes that this book will serve as a comprehensive, useful text and reference work for those engaged in teaching livestock management to young men and women and for those actively working in production agriculture careers.</p><p>Moscow, Idaho.

It systematically covers all types of speech modification (breath, voice, whisper, creak), articulation (the ways in which the air stream is finally modulated to generate specific types of sound), and prosodic features (stress, syllable, tone, intonation). This text also includes a chapter on sound systems--the ways in which particular languages utilize and systematize the universal sound-producing potential of humans. By actually articulating sounds and attending to the motor sensations they produce, readers acquire a deep, personal awareness of the principles of phonetic analysis and classification. <br> This second edition of <em>A Practical Introduction to Phonetics</em> features a new format and text design; updated use of phonetic symbols in line with the latest International Phonetic Alphabet Chart (1996); a revised further reading section that includes recent publications; and additional references to several important new publications. Informed throughout by recent research in aerodynamics and acoustics, this highly practical text is ideal for courses in introduction to phonetics and will be of interest to a wide range of students and teachers of languages, linguistics, speech therapy, and anthropology.<br></p><p><br>J.

Set in the 1950s, this unforgettable classic deftly evokes a tragic love affair and offers a window onto the powerful ways in which class, race, and love intersected in midcentury America.</p><p>Ann Petry (1908-1997), a black novelist, short story writer, and writer of books for young people, is one of America&#39;s most distinguished authors. Ann began by studying pharmacology, and in 1934, received her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of Connecticut College of Pharmacy. She worked as a registered pharmacist in Old Saybrook and in Lyme, and during these years wrote several short stories. When she married George David Petry in 1938, the course of her life changed. They lived in New York City, and Ann went to work for the Harlem Amsterdam News. By 1941, she was covering general news stories and editing the women&#39;s pages of the People&#39;s Voice in Harlem. Her first published story appeared in 1943 in the Crisis, a magazine published monthly by the NAACP. Subsequent to that, she began work on her first novel, The Street, which was published in 1946 and for which she received the Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship. Mrs. Petry has written two more novels, The Country Place and The Narrows, and numerous short stories, articles and children&#39;s books. In addition, she was appointed visiting professor of English at the University of Hawaii (1944 - 45) and has lectured widely throughout the United States. Ann returned with her husband to Old Saybrook in 1947 and lived there until here death. They have one daughter.&#x201c;Petry&#x2019;s novels are unique for their time, and brilliant expositions in the intricacies of their literary, political, philosophical, and social implications. Written in a period when deliberate black feminist fiction and black feminist interpretations of fiction were ideas whose time had not yet come, they were revolutionary.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;Nellie Y. McKay<br><br>&#x201c;Before the Bottom, before Brewster Place, there was the Narrows (also called the Eye of the Needle, the Bottom, Little Harlem, Dark Town, Niggertown). Before China, one of the whores in Toni Morrison&#x2019;s The Bluest Eye, there was China the whore who lived in the Narrows.Before Alice Walker&#x2019;s sexy blues singer Shug Avery, there was Mamie Powther, the busty, sensual, blues-singing woman desired by all the men of the Narrows and beyond. And before Milkman Dead, the middle-class protagonist of Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Song of Solomon, </i>was Link Williams, the Robesonesque lead character of Ann Petry&#x2019;s final novel, <i>The Narrows.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b></i><b>Farah Jasmine Griffin, Columbia University</b></p><h2>Plato&#39;s Revenge: Politics in the Age of Ecology (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A provocative essay that imagines a truly ecological future based on political transformation rather than the superficialities of &#x201c;sustainability.&#x201d; </b></p><p>In this provocative call for a new ecological politics, William Ophuls starts from a radical premise: &#x201c;sustainability&#x201d; is impossible. We are on an industrial <i>Titanic</i>, fueled by rapidly depleting stocks of fossil hydrocarbons. Making the deck chairs from recyclable materials and feeding the boilers with biofuels is futile. In the end, the ship is doomed by the laws of thermodynamics and by the implacable biological and geological limits that are already beginning to pinch. Ophuls warns us that we are headed for a postindustrial future that, however technologically sophisticated, will resemble the preindustrial past in many important respects. With <i>Plato's Revenge</i>, Ophuls, author of <i>Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity</i>, envisions political and social transformations that will lead to a new natural-law politics based on the realities of ecology, physics, and psychology.</p><p>In a discussion that ranges widely&#x2015;from ecology to quantum physics to Jungian psychology to Eastern religion to Western political philosophy&#x2015;Ophuls argues for an essentially Platonic politics of consciousness dedicated to inner cultivation rather than outward expansion and the pursuit of perpetual growth. We would then achieve a way of life that is materially and institutionally simple but culturally and spiritually rich, one in which humanity flourishes in harmony with nature.</p></p><p>William Ophuls is the author of the award-winning <i>Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity</i> and <i>Requiem for Modern Politics</i>.<p>I would strongly recommend<i> Plato's Revenge</i> as a clear and compelling polemic that deserves to be read alongside Bateson's 1972 work <i>Steps to an Ecology of Mind:</i><i>Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution and Epistemology</i>...and yes, alongside Plumwood's <i>Feminism and the Mastery of Nature</i>. Beyond the debate about Plato, all three have something important to say about the fate of our planet.</p>&#x2015;<i>Times Higher Education</i><br><br><p>It should be mandatory reading for everyone with any influence and is a delight to read even though its drift is hardly comforting. It is a devastating critique of modern Western thinking &#x2013; so good that I thought there was no point in my writing another word, since it says it all.</p>&#x2015;<i>Resurgence &amp; Ecologist</i></p><h2>Wildland Recreation Policy: An Introduction</h2><p>In terms of size and diversity, America&#39;s publicly-owned wildlands have few worldwide rivals. To protect these places and provide for human uses, we have created a complicated network of management agencies, which operate in a &#34;free fire zone&#34; of often conflicting values articulated by numerous citizen and business groups. Wildland Recreation Policy is not only about how our system of wildlands came to be, but also about the political process through which we decide how these places should and should not be used. Building on the historic origins of the National Park Service and USDA Forest Service, the authors show how the policy process affects current outdoor recreation management issues. The book&#39;s intent is to create awareness of the policy process and a knowledge structure for understanding how agencies can respond constructively to the myriad conflicts they face. This second edition expands representation of those whose interests have been overlooked a! nd whose voices have been silent, including the role of women in recreation policy. This completely updated edition also incorporates the effects of recent world events, including the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the Iraq War, and the differing environmental positions of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidential administrations.</p><p></p><h2>The Acid Reflux Escape Plan: Two Weeks to Heartburn Relief</h2><p><b>The Most Painless Approach to Adopting a GERD-Friendly Diet</b><br><b></b><br> Break free from painful heartburn with <i>The Acid Reflux Escape Plan</i>, a practical 2-week meal plan that empowers you to control your symptoms with smart dietary choices. &nbsp;Unlike other acid reflux cookbooks, <i>The Acid Reflux Escape Plan</i> includes detailed shopping lists and over 100 low-acid, low-fat, GERD-friendly recipes that cut out aggravating triggers without sacrificing flavor or taste.<br> <ul> <li>Detailed food lists and easy-to-understand explanations arm you against acid reflux attacks</li> <li>100 delicious low-acid, low-fat, low-irritant recipes won't trigger or exacerbate symptoms</li> <li>A step-by-step meal plan with shopping lists eases your transition to a GERD-friendly lifestyle</li> <li>A "Personal Triggers" guide helps you customize your diet to your body's unique needs</li> </ul> With <i>The Acid Reflux Escape Plan</i>, you're on the road to better health and a happier, symptom-free lifestyle.</p><p><p><strong>KAREN FRAZIER </strong>is a Seattle-based writer and nutrition and fitness expert who specializes in cookbooks for restrictive diets.

Before the eighteenth century, the very idea of nation-building&#x2015;a central component of nationalism&#x2015;did not exist. During this period, leading French intellectual and political figures came to see perfect national unity as a critical priority, and so sought ways to endow all French people with the same language, laws, customs, and values. The period thus gave rise to the first large-scale nationalist program in history.</p><p>David A. Bell is Professor of History, Princeton University.&#x201c;A notable addition to the expanding literature on nationalism in general and of French nationalism in particular, <i>The Cult of the Nation in France</i> explores how national affiliation became part of individual identity. It demonstrates the connections between nationalism and religion, without falling into the simple trap of treating nationalism as another religion. Against the present-day challenges faced by French republican nationalism, Bell insightfully examines the paradoxical process whereby the French came to posit themselves as a union of politically and spiritually like-minded citizens.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joan B. Landes, Pennsylvania State University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A formidably intelligent and beautifully written analysis of how the French came to perceive their nation as a political construction. Its breadth, together with its highly original discussion of the role of religion, makes <i>The Cult of the Nation in France</i> essential reading both for students of nationalism and for anyone wanting to understand current French debates on culture, ethnicity, and identity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Linda Colley, London School of Economics and Political Science</b><br><br>&#x201c;David Bell is one of the most talented young historians working in any field. This fascinating, brilliantly argued, and beautifully written study demonstrates the multi-stranded origins of the concept of the nation in France. Bell's major contribution is to place the timing of this crucial evolution well before the Revolution of 1789. He never loses sight of the linguistic and cultural complexity of France, bringing to a conclusion the story of French nationalism in our era.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Merriman, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Bell delineates the history of nationalism in France, tracing its origins to the 17th century. He shows how in 18th-century France, political and intellectual leaders made perfect national unity a priority, allowing the construction of the nation to take precedence over other political tasks. The goal was to provide all French people with the same language, laws, customs, and values. Bell argues that while the French leaders hoped that patriotism and national sentiment would replace religion as the binding force, it was actually religion that was a major (but not exclusive) factor in helping the French see the world around them. This period of history was the beginning of the first large-scale nationalist program. Bell also shows how the relationship between nationalism and religion contributes to the French national identity debate today. Bell's comprehensive and well-documented book is written in an accessible style...Recommended for French and European history collections.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Salony</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;At the center of Bell's subtle and intricate argument is religion. Religion, he suggests, was changing in the 18th century. And with men less likely to see God as an interventionist presence in their daily lives and more likely to stress God's distant, inscrutable quality, space was opened up for an autonomous realm of human action, described by a series of interconnected words: society, public opinion, civilization, fatherland and nation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Vinen</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;David Bell has interesting things to say about the French kindred and about an important aspect of their life together. <i>The Cult of the Nation in France</i> is about the way a particular kind of togetherness and a novel kind of identity were implanted, grew (and may have begun to wither) in France's fertile soil. The nation, he argues, is no spontaneous growth but a political artifact: not organic like a tree but constructed like a city.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eugen Weber</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bell argues in his excellent analysis of the 18th-century conceptual birth of French nationalism that nationalism emerged at a point when French intellectuals increasingly came to see God as distant from human affairs and sough to separate religious passions from political life...A masterful, thought-provoking [study].&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>P. G. Wallace</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This excellent book is at once a valuable account of the development of the concept of the nation in France and an important example of the use that can be made of the culture of print...Bell argues that right-wing nationalism has belonged consistently to a minority and that there has been a basic continuity in French republican nationalism over the past two centuries, views that not all will share, but arguments that testify to the importance of this well-crafted work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeremy Black</b><b>, </b><b><i>History</i></b></p><h2>Modern Arthurian Literature (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)</h2><p>First published in 1992.

Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro's groundbreaking research analyzes wealth - total assets and debts rather than income alone - to uncover deep and persistent racial inequality in America, and they show how public policies have failed to redress the problem.</p> <p>First published in 1995, <em>Black Wealth /</em> <em>White Wealth</em> is considered a classic exploration of race and inequality. It provided, for the first time, systematic empirical evidence that explained the racial inequality gap between blacks and whites. The Tenth Anniversary edition contains two entirely new and substantive chapters. These chapters look at the continuing issues of wealth and inequality in America and the new policies that have been launched in the past ten years. Some have been progressive while others only recreate inequality - for example the proposal to eliminate the estate tax.</p> <p>Compelling and also informative, <em>Black Wealth / White Wealth</em> is not just pioneering research. It is also a powerful counterpoint to arguments against affirmative action and a direct challenge to current social welfare policies that are tilted towards the wealthy.</p></p><p><strong>Melvin Oliver</strong> is Professor and Dean of Social Sciences, University of California-Santa Barbara.<br><strong>Thomas Shapiro</strong> is Professor, Brandeis University."...challenges the assertions that the failure of black entrepreneurship is rooted in a poor work ethic and an inability to defer gratification.

The controversial Russian noblewoman Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky told the world that the book restored humanity's lost history and destiny. Its insights, she said, had been gleaned from long-secret books of wisdom and her tutelage under mahatmas, or great souls: adepts from the East who exposed the seeker to their esoteric teaching. <br><br>To read <i>The Secret Doctrine </i>is to enter a mysterious world of ancient cosmology and spiritual-scientific insights, which tell of humanity's unthinkably ancient past and its burgeoning evolution into a new, more refined existence. <br><br>For the first time, Blavatsky's <i>encyclopedia arcana </i>is available in a reset and redesigned single-volume edition, complete and unabridged. Its truths and challenges are available to the intrepid reader, who may find yet-unknown insights within its pages.</p><p>Like a comet across the horizon of complacent Western civilization, MADAME HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY (1831-1891) appeared on the American scene in the early 1870s and almost single-handedly revived interest in the occult and esoteric, and also introduced many Westerners to the religious ideas of the East, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism. The world-traveled Russian noblewoman founded the Theosophical Society in New York City in 1875 to study the esoteric ideas behind the world's religions. She relocated to India in 1878, where she and her collaborator, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, a retired Civil War officer, helped inaugurate India's independence movement. Blavatsky moved to London in 1885, where she began writing her magnum opus,<i> The Secret Doctrine</i>--a vast, two-volume compendium of occult philosophy and a cosmological vision of humanity's lost history and secret destiny. Published in 1888, <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> became a formative influence on avant-garde artists and intellectuals, and propelled the dawning occult revival and alternative spiritual culture. Blavatksy died two years after its publication.COSMIC EVOLUTION.<br><br>In Seven Stanzas translated from the Book of Dzyan.<br><br>STANZA I.<br><br>1. The eternal parent wrapped in her ever invisible robes had slumbered once again for seven eternities.<br><br>2. Time was not, for it lay asleep in the infinite bosom of duration.<br><br>5. Universal mind was not, for there were no Ah-hi to contain it.<br><br>4. The seven ways to bliss were not. The great causes of misery were not, for there was no one to produce and get ensnared by them.<br><br>5. Darkness alone filled the boundless all, for father, mother and son were once more one, and the son had not awakened yet for the new wheel, and his pilgrimage thereon.<br><br>6. The seven sublime lords and the seven truths had ceased to be, and the Universe, the son of Necessity, was immersed in Paranishpanna, to be outbreathed by that which is and yet is not. Naught was.<br><br>7. The causes of existence had been done away with; the visible that was, and the invisible that is, rested in eternal non-being-the one being.<br><br>8. Alone the one form of existence stretched boundless, infinite, causeless, in dreamless sleep; and life pulsated unconscious in universal space, throughout that all-presence which is sensed by the opened eye of the Dangma.<br><br>9. But where was the Dangma when the Alaya of the universe was in Paramartha and the great wheel was Anupadaka?<br><br>STANZA II.<br><br>1. . . . Where were the builders, the luminous sons of Manvantaric dawn? . . . In the unknown darkness in their Ah-hi Paranishpanna. The producers of form from no-form-the root of the world-the Devamatri and Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat, rested in the bliss of non-being.<br><br>2. . . . Where was silence? Where the ears to sense it? No, there was neither silence nor sound; naught save ceaseless eternal breath, which knows itself not.<br><br>3. The hour had not yet struck; the ray had not yet flashed into the Germ; the Matripadma had not yet swollen.<br><br>4. Her heart had not yet opened for the one ray to enter, thence to fall, as three into four, into the lap of Maya.<br><br>5. The seven sons were not yet born from the web of light. Darkness alone was father-mother, Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat; and Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat was in darkness.<br><br>6. These two are the Germ, and the Germ is one. The Universe was still concealed in the Divine thought and the Divine bosom. . . .<br><br>STANZA III.<br><br>1. . . . The last vibration of the seventh eternity thrills through infinitude. The mother swells, expanding from within without, like the bud of the lotus.<br><br>2. The vibration sweeps along, touching with its swift wing the whole universe and the germ that dwelleth in darkness: the darkness that breathes over the slumbering waters of life . . .<br><br>3. Darkness radiates light, and light drops one solitary ray into the mother-deep. The ray shoots through the virgin egg the ray causes the eternal egg to thrill, and drop the non-eternal germ, which condenses into the world-egg.<br><br>4. Then the three fall into the four. The radiant essence becomes seven inside, seven outside. The luminous egg, which in itself is three, curdles and spreads in milk-white curds throughout the depths of mother, the root that grows in the depths of the ocean of life.<br><br>5. The root remains, the light remains, the curds remain, and still Oeaohoo is one.<br><br>6. The root of life was in every drop of the ocean of immortality, and the ocean was radiant light, which was fire, and heat, and motion. Darkness vanished and was no more; it disappeared in its own essence, the body of fire and water, or father and mother.<br><br>7. Behold, oh Lanoo! The radiant child of the two, the unparalleled refulgent glory: Bright Space Son of Dark Space, which emerges from the depths of the great dark waters. It is Oeaohoo the younger, the He shines forth as the son; he is the blazing Divine Dragon of Wisdom; the One is Four, and Four takes to itself Three, and the Union produces the Sapta, in whom are the seven which become the Tridasa (or the hosts and the multitudes). Behold him lifting the veil and unfurling it from east to west. He shuts out the above, and leaves the below to be seen as the great illusion. He marks the places for the shining ones, and turns the upper into a shoreless sea of fire, and the one manifested into the great waters.<br><br>8. Where was the germ and where was now darkness? Where is the spirit of the flame that burns in thy lamp, oh Lanoo? The germ is that, and that is light, the white brillant son of the dark hidden father.<br><br>9. Light is cold flame, and flame is fire, and fire produces heat, which yields water: the water of life in the great mother.<br><br>10. Father-Mother spin a web whose upper end is fastened to spirit-the light of the one darkness-and the lower one to its shadowy end, matter; and this web is the universe spun out of the two substances made in one, which is Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat.<br><br>11. It expands when the breath of fire is upon it; it contracts when the breath of the mother touches it. Then the sons dissociate and scatter, to return into their mother's bosom at the end of the great day, and re-become one with her; when it is cooling it becomes radiant, and the sons expand and contract through their own selves and hearts; they embrace infinitude.<br><br>12. Then Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat sends Fohat to harden the atoms. Each is a part of the web. Reflecting the "Self-Existent Lord" like a mirror, each becomes in turn a world.<br><br>STANZA IV.<br><br>1. . . . Listen ye Sons of the Earth, to your instructors-the Sons of the Fire. Learn, there is neither first nor last, for all is one: number issued from no number.<br><br>2. Learn what we who descend from the Primordial Seven, we who are born from the Primordial Flame, have learnt from our fathers. . . .<br><br>3. From the effulgency of light-the ray of the ever-darkness-sprung in space the re-awakened energies; the one from the egg, the six, and the five. Then the three, the one, the four, the one, the five-the twice seven the sum total. And these are the essences, the flames, the elements, the builders, the numbers, the arupa, the rupa, and the force of Divine Man-the sum total. And from the Divine Man emanated the forms, the sparks, the sacred animals, and the messengers of the sacred fathers within the holy four.<br><br>4. This was the army of the voice-the divine mother of the seven. The sparks of the seven are subject to, and the servants of, the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh of the seven. These "sparks" are called spheres, triangles, cubes, lines, and modellers; for thus stands the Eternal Nidana-the Oeaohoo, which is:<br><br>5. "Darkness" the boundless, or the no-number, Adi-Nidana Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat:-<br><br>I. The Adi-Sanat, the number, for he is one.<br><br>II. The voice of the Lord Sv&#x2030;bh&#x2030;vat, the numbers, for he is one and nine.<br><br>III. The "formless square."<br><br>And these three enclosed within the are the sacred four; and the ten are the arupa universe. Then come the "sons," the seven fighters, the one, the eighth left out, and his breath which is the light-maker.<br><br>6. Then the second seven, who are the Lipika, produced by the three. The rejected son is one. The "Son-suns" are countless.<br><br>STANZA V.<br><br>1. The Primordial Seven, the First Seven Breaths of the Dragon of Wisdom, produce in their turn from their Holy Circumgyrating Breaths the Fiery Whirlwind.<br><br>2. They make of him the messenger of their will. The Dzyu becomes Fohat, the swift son of the Divine sons whose sons are the Lipika, runs circular errands. Fohat is the steed and the thought is the rider. He passes like lightning through the fiery clouds; takes three, and five, and seven strides through the seven regions above, and the seven below. He lifts his voice, and calls the innumerable sparks, and joins them.<br><br>3. He is their guiding spirit and leader. When he commences work, he separates the sparks of the Lower Kingdom that float and thrill with joy in their radiant dwellings, and forms therewith the germs of wheels. He places them in the six directions of space, and one in the middle-the central wheel.<br><br>4. Fohat traces spiral lines to unite the sixth to the seventh-the crown; an army of the Sons of Light stands at each angle, and the Lipika in the middle wheel. They say: This is good, the first Divine world is ready, the first is now the second. Then the "Divine Arupa" reflects itself in Chhaya Loka, the first garment of the Anupadaka.<br><br>5. Fohat takes five strides and builds a winged wheel at each corner of the square, for the four holy ones and their armies.<br><br>6. The Lipika circumscribe the triangle, the first one, the cube, the second one, and the pentacle within the egg. It is the ring called "Pass Not" for those who descend and ascend. Also for those who during the Kalpa are progressing towards the great day "Be with us." Thus were formed the Rupa and the Arupa: from one light seven lights; from each of the seven, seven times seven lights. The wheels watch the ring. . . . .<br><br>STANZA VI.<br><br>1. By the power of the Mother of Mercy and Knowledge-Kwan-Yin-the "triple" of Kwan-shai-Yin, residing in Kwan-yin-Tien, Fohat, the Breath of their Progeny, the Son of the Sons, having called forth, from the lower abyss, the illusive form of Sien Tchang and the Seven Elements:<br><br>2. The Swift and Radiant One produces the Seven Laya Centres, against which none will prevail to the great day "Be-with-Us," and seats the Universe on these Eternal Foundations surrounding Tsien-Tchan with the Elementary Germs.<br><br>3. Of the Seven-first one manifested, six concealed, two manifested, five concealed; three manifested, four concealed; four produced, three hidden; four and one tsan revealed, two and one half concealed; six to be manifested, one laid aside. Lastly, seven small wheels revolving; one giving birth to the other.<br><br>4. He builds them in the likeness of older wheels, placing them on the Imperishable Centres.<br><br>How does Fohat build them? he collects the fiery dust. He makes balls of fire, runs through them, and round them, infusing life thereinto, then sets them into motion; some one way, some the other way. They are cold, he makes them hot. They are dry, he makes them moist. They shine, he fans and cools them. Thus acts Fohat from one twilight to the other, during Seven Eternities.<br><br>5. At the fourth, the sons are told to create their images. One third refuses-two obey.<br><br>The curse is pronounced; they will be born on the fourth, suffer and cause suffering; this is the first war.<br><br>6. The older wheels rotated downwards and upwards. . . . The mother's spawn filled the whole. There were battles fought between the Creators and the Destroyers, and battles fought for space; the seed appearing and re-appearing continuously.<br><br>7. Make thy calculations, Lanoo, if thou wouldest learn the correct age of thy small wheel. Its fourth spoke is our mother. Reach the fourth "fruit" of the fourth path of knowledge that leads to Nirvana, and thou shalt comprehend, for thou shalt see. . . . .<br><br>STANZA VII.<br><br>1. Behold the beginning of sentient formless life.<br><br>First the Divine, the one from the Mother-Spirit; then the Spiritual; the three from the one, the four from the one, and the five from which the three, the five, and the seven. These are the three-fold, the four-fold downward; the "mind-born" sons of the first Lord; the shining seven.<br><br>It is they who are thou, me, him, oh Lanoo. They, who watch over thee, and thy mother earth.<br><br>2. The one ray multiplies the smaller rays. Life precedes form, and life survives the last atom of form. Through the countless rays proceeds the life-ray, the one, like a thread through many jewels.<br><br>3. When the one becomes two, the threefold appears, and the three are one; and it is our thread, oh Lanoo, the heart of the man-plant called Saptasarma.<br><br>4. It is the root that never dies; the three-tongued flame of the four wicks. The wicks are the sparks, that draw from the three-tongued flame shot out by the seven-their flame-the beams and sparks of one moon reflected in the running waves of all the rivers of earth.<br><br>5. The spark hangs from the flame by the finest thread of Fohat. It journeys through the Seven Worlds of Maya. It stops in the first, and is a metal and a stone; it passes into the second and behold-a plant; the plant whirls through seven changes and becomes a sacred animal. From the combined attributes of these, Manu, the thinker is formed. Who forms him? the seven lives, and the one life. Who completes him? The five-fold Lha. And who perfects the last body? Fish, sin, and soma.. . . .<br><br>6. From the first-born the thread between the Silent Watcher and his Shadow becomes more strong and radiant with every change. The morning sun-light has changed into noon - day glory.. . . .<br><br>7. This is thy present wheel, said the Flame to the Spark. Thou art myself, my image, and my shadow. I have clothed myself in thee, and thou art my Vahan to the day, "Be with us," when thou shalt re-become myself and others, thyself and me. Then the builders, having donned their first clothing, descend on radiant earth and reign over men-who are themselves. . . .<br><br>Thus ends this portion of the archaic narrative, dark, confused, almost incomprehensible. An attempt will now be made to throw light into this darkness, to make sense out of this apparent non-sense.<br><br>COMMENTARIES<br><br>on the seven stanzas and their terms, according to their numeration, in stanzas and slokas.<br><br>STANZA I.<br><br>1. "The Eternal Parent (Space), wrapped in her ever invisible robes, had slumbered once again for seven eternities (a)."<br><br>The "Parent Space" is the eternal, ever present cause of all-the incomprehensible deity, whose "invisible robes" are the mystic root of all matter, and of the Universe. Space is the one eternal thing that we can most easily imagine, immovable in its abstraction and uninfluenced by either the presence or absence in it of an objective Universe. It is without dimension, in every sense, and self-existent. Spirit is the first differentiation from That, the causeless cause of both Spirit and Matter. It is, as taught in the esoteric catechism, neither limitless void, nor conditioned fulness, but both. It was and ever will be.

Unlike most SPICE books, which simply present SPICE in a how-to-use fashion, this volume outlines how SPICE is used in the process of design itself. It features methodologies for analyzing transistor and op amp circuits, over 100 SPICE examples, and numerous chapter problems. Intended to accompany Sedra &amp; Smith's <em>Microelectronic Circuits, 4/e</em>, this book can also stand alone as a manual for computer-aided circuit analysis for microelectronic circuits. <br> SPICE decks and the examples in this book, as well as examples from the first edition, are all available on-line via the World Wide Web at http://www.macs.ece.mcgill.ca/~roberts/ROBERTS/SPICE/.

Have you ever asked yourself how a rainbow is formed, why the setting sun is red and flattened, or even why the sky at night is not absolutely black? If so, then allow David Lynch to provide you with the answers. This beautiful and informative guide provides clear explanations to all naturally occurring optical phenomena seen with the naked eye. It offers complete and easy-to-understand insights into shadows, halos, water optics, mirages and a host of other spectacles. Separating myth from reality, it outlines the basic principles involved, and supports them with many figures and references. A wealth of rare and spectacular photographs, many in full colour, illustrate these phenomena throughout, with many helpful hints on how you can best observe and photograph them. Color and Light in Nature provides a complete, well-illustrated, and authoritative guide to seeing, photographing and understanding nature&#39;s optical delights.</p><p>Why is the sky blue? Why do mountains glow in the dark? Is the darkest always before the dawn?<p> An ideal reference to have on hand in answering questions such as these, <i>Color and Light in Nature</i> is an endlessly fascinating exploration of phenomena that are familiar to us all, but that even trained scientists take for granted. Take the question of why stars twinkle, for instance: twinkling, astronomers Lynch and Livingston observe, is strongest with stars that are low in the sky, and then on a clear and windy night, when starlight passing through the atmosphere encounters little pockets of turbulence that bend its rays "momentarily away from our eyes." Sunlight undergoes similar distortions, yielding mirages, "blinks," sundogs, halos, rainbows, "mountain light," and other wonders of nature, all of which the authors describe and explain in clear and accessible prose. </p><p> Lynch and Livingston encourage their readers to seek out and study these phenomena for themselves, writing, for instance, "No effort should be spared to witness at least one total eclipse in your lifetime." They go on to make a good case for why that should be so, and why the workings of light and color should be of interest to students of science. Their book is a lively companion and teacher. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>An authoritative guide that provides beautiful illustrations and clear explanations of all naturally occurring optical phenomena seen with the naked eye.</p><h2>The Beautiful and Damned (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles. Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p><i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, tells the story of Anthony Patch, a 1920s socialite and presumptive heir to a tycoon's fortune, the relationship with his wife Gloria, his service in the army, and alcoholism. Anthony and Gloria are young and gorgeous, rich and leisured and they dedicate their lives to the pursuit of happiness and we follow the intimate story of their marriage as it disintegrates under the weight of their expectations, fuelled by dissipation, jealousy and aimlessness. </p><p>Fitzgerald skilfully portrays the Eastern elite as the Jazz Age begins its ascent, engulfing all classes into what will soon be known as Caf� Society. As with all of his other novels, it is a brilliant character study and is also an early account of the complexities of marriage and intimacy, largely based on Fitzgerald's relationship and marriage with Zelda Fitzgerald.</p><p>With an afterword by Ned Halley.</p></p><p>This edition includes a detailed account of the composition of the novel, a textual apparatus, a chronology of composition, and, uniquely, three versions of the ending. Explanatory notes situate The Beautiful and Damned in its times and deepen the reader&#39;s understanding of Fitzgerald&#39;s sources for the novel.Following the great critical and financial success of his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald published <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> in 1922. An immediate success upon its first publication, Fitzgerald's second novel is a dazzling portrait of love and life among the beautiful people. Through the story of two newlyweds, Anthony Patch of New York and Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City, Fitzgerald flawlessly captures the heady atmosphere and jaded values of the Jazz Age. Patch, expecting to become the sole heir to his grandfather's millions, embraces a life of endless parties and intellectual pretensions. In Gloria, he finds an exquisite ornament and a passionate lover. The couple whirls through days that mirror Fitzgerald's own--a fast life amid a smart set for which there is never enough cash. Beginning with wit and clever repartee, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> quickly becomes a scathing chronicle of a dying marriage and a hedonistic society where beauty is all too fleeting. Through the character of Richard Caramel, a successful hack writer whose talent fails as he prospers, Fitzgerald caricatures himself. But today's readers will find an even more poignant self-portrait of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda in Anthony and Gloria, a couple whose days of wine and roses fade quickly toward a tragic end.</p><h2>Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and counter-history</h2><p><p> Through a lifetime of passionate scholarship, Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) uncovered the "domains of tradition hidden under the debris of centuries" and made the history of Jewish mysticism and messianism comprehensible and relevant to current Jewish thought. </p><p> In this paperback edition of his definitive book on Scholem's work, David Biale has shortened and rearranged his study for the benefit of the general reader and the student. A new introduction and new passages in the main text highlight the pluralistic character of Jewish theology as seen by Scholem, the place of the Kabbalah in debates over Zionism versus assimilation, and the interpretation of Kafka as a Jewish writer. </p></p><p>Through a lifetime of passionate scholarship, Gershom Scholem uncovered the &#39;domains of tradition hidden under the debris of centuries&#39; and made the history of Jewish mysticism and messianism comprehensible and relevant to current Jewish thought.David Biale teaches in the Judaic Studies Program at the State University of New York at Binghamton.</p><h2>Rebirth Of The Goddess: Finding Meaning In Feminist Spirituality</h2><p>Examines the rebirth of the religion of the Goddess through a discussion of the principles, practices, and beliefs of feminist spirituality</p><p><strong>Carol P. Christ</strong> is Director of the Ariadne Institute for the Study of Myth and Ritual. Her previous books include <em>Diving Deep and Surfacing</em> (1995) and <em>Laughter of</em> <em>Aphrodite</em> (1993).Christ (Odyssey with the Goddess, LJ 3/1/95) manages to combine heart and intellect in her latest work, melding personal experience with goddess studies and her scholarship. She discusses who the goddess is, what her history is, why there is resistance to her, and what she means. Christ is sensitive to different meanings of the goddess?e.g., transcendent, immanent, nature personified, and indwelling presence?and shares her own perceptions, informed and changed by recent experiences living in Greece. Christ finds the goddess especially in life-giving and life-affirming processes integral to existence. The final chapter of her work articulates an ethos focused on affirmation of beauty, life, and love rather than on patriarchal domination, power, and violence. Highly recommended both for those who do not know goddess religion and for those who do.?Carolyn M.

Not only did Jefferson design the State Capitol in Richmond, his home Monticello, his country retreat Poplar Forest, and the University of Virginia; after his death, master builders continued to construct important examples of Jeffersonian classicism in Albemarle County and beyond.</p><p>But what is less well known are the many important examples of other architectural idioms built in this Piedmont Virginia county, many by nationally renowned architects. At the turn of the twentieth century, the renewed interest of wealthy clients in eclectic architectural styles attracted some of the finest Beaux Arts architects in the country to the Charlottesville area. Grand new buildings complemented and competed with the Jeffersonian models of a hundred years earlier. In addition, throughout its history Albemarle County has seen construction of a great variety of public architectural landmarks: mills and churches, movie theaters and hospitals, gas stations and taverns.</p><p>For many years K. Edward Lay has been teaching, guiding tours of, and writing about this rich architectural legacy. Here at last is his definitive treatment of a topic that has been his life's work, presented in an elegantly illustrated volume. Following a general introduction by John S. Salmon, Lay divides his book into six chronological chapters: "The Georgian Period," "Thomas Jefferson and His Builders," "The Roman Revival (1800-1830)," "The Greek Revival (1830-1860)," "Beyond the Classical Revival," and "The Eclectic Era (1890-1939)." He discusses over 800 buildings, from a Sears house to grand estates, the Abell-Gleason house and the Albemarle County Jail to Wavertree Hall and Zion Baptist Church, with 26 color photographs and 369 black-and-white illustrations complementing his text. A final chapter discusses the University of Virginia. Maps of the area allow readers and visitors to trace the locations of individual buildings and to recognize trends of settlement and construction in the area.</p><p>As an elegant giftbook or reference, The Architecture of Jefferson Country gives architects, historians, visitors, and residents an unprecedented view of the wealth of buildings in Charlottesville and Albemarle County.</p></p><p><p>K.

Albemarle County's architecture mirrors national trends, but also from its soil sprang some of the United States' most refined and historically significant creations and styles. From Thomas Jefferson's important essays at Monticello and the University of Virginia to the sophisticated work of twentieth-century Colonial Revivalists, Albemarle County and Charlottesville contain critically important architecture of interest to the entire nation, indeed, to the world.</p> (<i>Richard Guy Wilson, author of Thomas Jefferson's Academical Village: The Creation of an Architectural Masterpiece and coauthor of The Making of Virginia Architecture</i>)<br><br><p>In The Architecture of Jefferson Country Professor Lay draws upon decades of fieldwork and research to provide a detailed portrait of the architectural riches of Albemarle County and Charlottesville.

Rappaport and Mauboussin provide everything the reader needs to utilize the discounted cash flow model successfully. And they add an important twist: they suggest that rather than forecasting cash flows, investors should begin by estimating the expectations embedded in a company's stock price. An investor who has a fix on the market's expectations can then assess the likelihood of expectations revisions. To help investors anticipate such revisions, Rappaport and Mauboussin introduce an "expectations infrastructure" framework for tracing the process of value creation from the basic economic forces that shape a company's performance to the resulting impact on sales, costs, and investment. Investors who use <i>Expectations Investing</i> will have a fundamentally new way to evaluate all stocks, setting them on the path to success. Managers will be able to use the book to devise, adjust, and communicate their company's strategy in light of shareholder expectations.</p><p>Alfred Rappaport is the Leonard Spacek Professor Emeritus at Northwestern&#39;s Kellogg School and is Shareholder Value Adviser to L.E.K.

They discuss sample companies (Gateway), historical patterns, competitive strategies and share value. Though they expertly simplify a complex topic, beginners may find the book overly technical.

They have had great success in conflating unfettered gun ownership with the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, and all things American, even in an era of repeated mass shootings. Yet the all-too-familiar narrative of America's gun past, echoed in the Supreme Court's Heller gun rights decision, is not only mythologized, but historically wrong. <br><br>As Robert J. Spitzer demonstrates in <em>Guns across America</em>, gun ownership is as old as the nation, but so is gun regulation. Drawing on a vast new dataset of early gun laws reflecting every imaginable type of regulation, Spitzer reveals that firearms were actually more strictly regulated in the country's first three centuries than in recent years. The first "gun grabbers" were not 1960's Chablis-drinking liberals, but seventeenth century rum-guzzling pioneers, and their legacy continued through strict gun regulations in the 1920s and beyond. Spitzer examines interpretations of the Second Amendment, the assault weapons controversy, modern "stand your ground" laws, and the so-called "right of rebellion" to show that they play out in America's contemporary political landscape in ways that bear little resemblance to our imagined past. And as gun rights proponents seek to roll back gun laws and press as many guns into as many hands as possible, warning that gun rights are endangered, they sidestep the central question: are stricter gun laws incompatible with robust gun rights? Spitzer answers this question by examining New York State's tough gun laws, where his political analysis is complemented by his own quest for a concealed carry handgun permit and construction of a legal AR-15 assault weapon. <br><br>Not only can gun rights and rules coexist, but they have throughout American history. <em>Guns across America</em> reveals the long-hidden truth: that gun regulations are in fact as American as apple pie<br></p><p><br>Robert J. Spitzer is Distinguished Service Professor and Chair of the Political Science Department at SUNY Cortland. He is the author of 15 books, including five on the presidency and five on gun policy, and of over 600 articles, essays, and papers appearing in many books, journals, newspapers, and web sites on many American politics subjects.

This book is not an example of that genre. It is an attempt to interpret Buddhism in the light of some current theories about religion. As a work of scholarship, rather than a homiletic tract or an apologetic treatise, its aim is to understand Buddhism as one historical variant of the generic human attempt to find meaning and hope in a sacred order that transcends the mundane order of existence; its aime is not to encourage or discourage either a devotional or a soteriological interest in Buddhism.</p><p>Melford Elliot "Mel" Spiro (April 26, 1920 &#x2013; October 18, 2014) was an American cultural anthropologist specializing in religion and psychological anthropology.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wallach&#39;s Interpretation of Diagnostic Tests: Pathways to Arriving at a Clinical Diagnosis (Interpretation of Diagnostric Tests)</h2><p>Ordering the right test at the right time can be a complex process.

It does so with a unique approach that combines fundamentals first with objects early. The book transitions smoothly through a carefully selected set of procedural programming fundamentals to object-oriented fundamentals. During this early transition and beyond, the book emphasizes problem solving. For example, Chapter 2 is devoted to algorithm development, Chapter 8 is devoted to program design, and problem-solving sections appear throughout the book.<p> The second edition adds new language features and end-of-chapter GUI sections that include animation. New chapters include an introduction to the Java Collections Framework and an in-depth treatment of recursion. Two new supplementary chapters on the book&#x2019;s companion website describe the JavaFX GUI platform.</p><p> Before diving into object-oriented programming (OOP) in Chapter 6, the second edition includes a &#x201c;mini-chapter&#x201d; that describes how to write multiple-method programs in a non-OOP environment. Those who want to continue this theme can follow an optional &#x201c;late objects&#x201d; approach by reading two chapters on the book&#x2019;s website before returning to OOP in Chapter 6. Some key features include:</p><p> �A conversational, easy-to-follow writing style.</p><p> �Simple GUI programming early, in an optional standalone graphics track.</p><p> �Well-identified alternatives for altering the book's sequence to fit individual needs.</p><p> �Well-developed projects in six different academic disciplines, with a handy summary.</p><p> �Detailed customizable PowerPointTM lecture slides, with icon-keyed hidden notes.</p><p> I have used the Dean and Dean book in my Introduction to Java Programming class for the past year. This is an excellent text and I am very happy with it. It is the only text that I have ever used that always gets positive comments from students on my class evaluations even though there is no question asked about the text. The chapters are well thought out and the coverage is complete. The progression from topic-to-topic is masterful, and the writing is exceptionally clear and at the perfect level for an introductory Java class. </p><p>&#x2013; Ralph Duffy, South Seattle Community College</p></p><p></p><h2>Resurrection: The Struggle for a New Russia</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lenin&#39;s Tomb now presents the crucial second act--the attempt to form a Russian state from the ruins of the U.S.S.R. and the chaotic election of 1996. As before, readers will turn to Remnick for the essential story, the flesh-and-blood account of one of history&#39;s great turning points.</p><p>In his first account of Russia, <i>Lenin's Tomb,</i> David Remnick wrote a history paced like a thriller that recast the common understanding of the last days of the Soviet Empire. While most reporters mouthed the standard lines about the "fall of communism," Remnick delivered a gripping account of how the old order in which gangsters ruled through brutal state power lost its hold on the Russian people. Remnick's stunning reportage cut away the myths of the Soviet system to provide the first account of how Eastern Europeans and former citizens of the Soviet Union had long viewed the Soviet regime. The book won the young author his first Pulitzer Prize. <p> In his new and equally superb book <i>Resurrection</i>, Remnick offers clear-eyed commentary on how the old order of gangsters has given way to a new order. Russia's power elite, he tells us, has embraced the tools and techniques of markets and electioneering to maintain power, while organized crime is fast becoming a major force in the economy. Remnick also describes how the changes in Russia have effected the people themselves. Heart-wrenching chapters on the war in Chechnya, the health and welfare of children (only 15 percent of school children are classified as healthy, and 50 percent are unfit for military service), and the diminished state of Russian letters and literature chronicle the suffering of a once proud nation as it attempts to rebuild itself. <i>Resurrection</i> makes good on Remnick's name and reputation as the best American writer on Russia today.</p>David Remnick is a staff writer at The New Yorker.</p><h2>Computer Science Principles: The Foundational Concepts of Computer Science - For AP� Computer Science Principles</h2><p>Computer science is the world's fastest growing field of study, and this growth is showing no signs of slowing down.

Lyrical, wise, compelling: the novels are a wonderful imaginative feat&#39; SARAH WATERS In the final novel of her stunning trilogy, Mary Renault vividly imagines the life of Alexander the Great, the charismatic leader whose drive and ambition created a legend. Alexander the Great died at the age of thirty-three, leaving behind an empire that stretched from Greece and Egypt to India. After Alexander&#39;s death in 323 B.C. his only direct heirs were two unborn sons and a simpleton half-brother. Every long-simmering faction exploded into the vacuum of power. Wives, distant relatives and generals all vied for the loyalty of the increasingly undisciplined Macedonian army. Most failed and were killed in the attempt. For no one possessed the leadership to keep the great empire from crumbling. But Alexander&#39;s legend endured to spread into worlds he had seen only in dreams. &#39;Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us&#39; - HILARY MANTEL &#39;The Alexander Trilogy stands as one of the most important works of fiction in the 20th century . . . it represents the pinnacle of [Renault&#39;s] career . . . Renault&#39;s skill is in immersing us in their world, drawing us into its strangeness, its violence and beauty.

This book is for anyone who would like to enter that world, whether or not he has ever used a microscope before. No special knowledge is required. In non-technical language and with generous use of illustration, the author explains how a microscope works and what kind to use; how to adjust the instrument and position the specimens to be viewed; examination of simple objects: a human hair, feathers, milk. At the same time, he shows how to prepare the objects, what to purchase for the purpose, how to care for it; one's every question is anticipated and clearly answered. The fundamentals understood, the reader is taken into further exploration viewing insect parts, diatoms, plankton, molds, leaves, ferns, fruit rinds, fish scales, animal parts. As we proceed, we learn step by step the techniques involved: use of chloroform, preparation of permanent slides, mounting in glycerine, preparing dye solutions, dissection, and blood smearing. We learn how to detect fat, find Vitamin C in food substances, prepare a frog for examination, view and distinguish bacteria, use the oil-immersion objective, dye bacilli spores, do microphotography, cut sections with the microtome. <br>Following Dr. Stehli's careful instructions, we have entered and gone well into the fascinating world of microscopy. The invention of the microscope itself started science on new courses, entire fields of new knowledge. The use of a comparatively simple microscope today can start one on a lifetime interest, an absorbing hobby, a career in science, or a permanent addition to one's cultural background. This book provides all the help needed, whether one is adult or student, hobbyist or scientifically serious, seeking education or merely curious about the minute world that exists all about us. 119 photographs and drawings.</p><p></p></p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Seeing Nature: Deliberate Encounters with the Visible World</h2><p>Seeing Nature is a series of true stories or parables that offer tools for understanding relationships in the natural world. Many of the stories take the reader to wild landscapes, including canyons, tundra, and mountain ridges, while others contemplate the human-made world: water-diversion trenches and supermarket check-out lines. At one point, Krafel discovers a world in a one-inch-square patch of ordinary ground. Inspiring for parents and teachers seeking to encourage excitement about the positive role of people in nature, Krafel's work harkens to St. Exupery's The Little Prince, Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and Jean Giono's The Man Who Planted Trees. As Barbara Damrosch has noted: This book] is a gift.... With curiosity, wit, and a spare and graceful style, Krafel notes why birds in flocks land as they do, how islands can move upstream in a river, how kelp forests, swaying gently, break the force of the sea's power, how tundra plants create whole ecosystems on bare rock from mere specks of life. Yet there are no long-winded sermons about the woods, or cute anthropomorphizations of animals. The book's economical, unsentimental style is part of its originality. Paul Krafel's years as a park ranger afforded him time to walk and think&#x2014;his job was to observe the world around him. He is now a teacher, creating a curriculum for young people that is built on a startlingly simple truth: The world around us is an extended conversation between "upward spirals"&#x2014;nature in regenerative, procreative modes&#x2014;and downward spirals toward entropy and disintegration. As nature refreshes and rebuilds, the downward spirals are overcome. Nature's process becomes the process of replenishing hope.</p><p><p>Paul Krafel and his family live in Cottonwood, California, where he is a founding teacher at Chrysalis, a chartered public school emphasizing nature study.</p>Krafel gets his insights while exploring granite basins deep in the Rockies that once cradled Ice Age glaciers, or while watching a million heliotropic buttercups' synchronized turning toward the sun on the Arctic tundra, or while climbing into an ancient cliff dwelling that housed the Hopis' ancestors. His deeply personal, lyrical meditation beckons readers to see the world as a spiral of coevolution, whereby life forms grow symbiotically through small, accumulating changes, rather than in linear cause-and-effect fashion. A former park ranger and naturalist with the National Park Service for eight years, Krafel is now a teacher in Northern California, where he and his wife founded Chrysalis, a chartered public school operating out of a natural science museum, with emphasis on nature study outdoors. Originally self-published 10 years ago under the title Shifting, this quietly ambitious book is an individualistic attempt to reorient everyday observation along the lines of the Gaia hypothesis formulated by scientists James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, who envision Earth as a single, gigantic, self-regulating organism. The book unfolds as a series of perceptual exercises and intense interactions with the natural world. Though Krafel seems to aspire to the soaring lyricism of Annie Dillard or Loren Eiseley, he seldom achieves their profundity, and while some of his examples are illuminating, others are murky or pedestrian. Nevertheless, his inquiry beautifully underscores his central message that we tend to become what we practice: hope spirals into new possibilities, while cynicism restricts one's range of vision and begets more cynicism.

Packer's long essay "The Transcendentalists" is widely acknowledged by scholars of nineteenth-century American literary history as the best-written, most comprehensive treatment to date of Transcendentalism. Previously existing only as part of a volume in the magisterial Cambridge History of American Literature, it will now be available for the first time in a stand-alone edition.</p><p>Packer presents Transcendentalism as a living movement, evolving out of such origins as New England Unitarianism and finding early inspiration in European Romanticism. Transcendentalism changed religious beliefs, philosophical ideas, literary styles, and political allegiances. In addition, it was a social movement whose members collaborated on projects and formed close personal ties. Transcendentalism contains vigorous thought and expression throughout, says Packer; only a study of the entire movement can explain its continuing sway over American thought.</p><p>Through fresh readings of both the essential Transcendentalist texts and the best current scholarship, Packer conveys the movement's genuine expectations that its radical spirituality not only would lead to personal perfection but also would inspire solutions to such national problems as slavery and disfranchisement. Here is Transcendentalism in whole, with Emerson, Thoreau, and Fuller restored to their place alongside such contemporaries as Bronson Alcott, George Ripley, Jones Very, Theodore Parker, James Freeman Clarke, Orestes Brownson, and Frederick Henry Hedge.</p></p><p>BARBARA L. PACKER (1947&#x2013;2010) was a professor emerita of English at the University of California, Los Angeles. She is the author of <i>Emerson's Fall</i>.<p>It is curious that in a field long distinguished for its historical scholarship, no satisfactory comprehensive history of the Transcendentalist movement has appeared since 1876. Packer's <i>The Transcendentalists</i> answers that need effectively in an engagingly written study grounded in fresh readings of primary sources and a synthetic command of the best recent scholarship.</p> (David M. Robinson <i>American Literary Scholarship</i>)<br><br><p>This is simply the best contemporary account of Transcendentalism that we have. Packer writes free of jargon and is exact and comprehensive in handling the sweep of thought necessary to discuss the topic.</p> (Robert N. Hudspeth <i>editor of <i>The Letters of Margaret Fuller</i></i>)<br><br><p>This is the best extended study of Transcendentalism available. Packer's is the only attempt to study and evaluate the movement as a whole. Particularly good are her discussions of the religious, literary, and philosophical aspects of Transcendentalism; her discussion of the Transcendentalists' responses to slavery is a gem. She is a graceful writer and succeeds in dealing with a complex topic.</p> (Joel Myerson <i>coeditor of <i>The Selected Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></i>)</p><h2>Instructing Hatha Yoga</h2><p><p>Yoga is one of the fastest-growing fitness activities worldwide, and qualified yoga instructors are in high demand. <i>Instructing Hatha Yoga</i> describes the qualities and knowledge yoga instructors need in order to be competent and effective teachers.

From pulsing port cities to Midwestern farms and southern plantations, an adolescent nation hailed Latin America&#x2019;s independence movements as glorious tropical reprises of 1776. Even as Latin Americans were gradually ending slavery, U.S. observers remained energized by the belief that their founding ideals were triumphing over European tyranny among their &#x201c;sister republics.&#x201d; But as slavery became a violently divisive issue at home, goodwill toward antislavery revolutionaries waned. By the nation&#x2019;s fiftieth anniversary, republican efforts abroad had become a scaffold upon which many in the United States erected an ideology of white U.S. exceptionalism that would haunt the geopolitical landscape for generations. Marshaling groundbreaking research in four languages, Caitlin Fitz defines this hugely significant, previously unacknowledged turning point in U.S. history. 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Caitlin Fitz lives in Evanston, Illinois, where she is assistant professor of history at Northwestern University. She has received numerous honors, including a Fulbright Fellowship, an Andrew Mellon Fellowship, and Yale University&#x2019;s Egleston Historical Prize.&#x201c;[Fitz] is a deft guide to this reinterpretation of early American history, a time when &#x2018;earlier rhetoric of inalienable rights and self-evident truths was increasingly challenged by assertions of white superiority and U.S. exceptionalism&#x2019;... Fitz shows that history is not always written by wars, treaties, and administrative actions; often, the people take the lead.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This study, based on strong academic foundations and written in captivating and elegant prose, is an impressive achievement that suggests intriguing origins of American exceptionalism.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Caitlin Fitz&#x2019;s thrilling investigation is as notable for its readability as for the broad significance of its claims. Fitz introduces us to a United States where South American independence movements were embraced by a surprisingly wide range of U.S. residents, where hemispheric fellowship trumped racism, and both black and white children were named Bolivar. Much like the newspaper editors quoted within its pages, <em>Our Sister Republics</em> provides &#x2018;an alternative picture of who we might have been, and just maybe, whom we might become.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amy Greenberg, author of <em>A Wicked War: Polk, Clay, Lincoln, and the 1846 U.S. Invasion of Mexico</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;During the latter half of the Age of Revolution (1775-1825) many South American peoples threw off their colonial ties to Spain and Portugal and declared their independence. Residents of the United States hailed the birth of these nations and named towns and sons after Simon Bolivar. In this original and stimulating book, Caitlin Fitz shows how these ovations turned sour for many slave-state citizens when the new republics south of the border abolished slavery&#x2015;one more example of the increasingly divisive politics of slavery in North America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James M. McPherson, author of <em>The War That Shaped a Nation: Why the Civil War Still Matters</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Caitlin Fitz&#x2019;s <em>Our Sister Republics</em>&nbsp;is a tremendous accomplishment. Fitz&#x2019;s bold and convincing argument removes the early history of the United States from its provincial cloister, revealing the transnational origins of American Exceptionalism, the ways in which the United States&#x2019; sense of its republican uniqueness was formed, since its very inception, in engagement with Spanish and Portuguese America. A timely, compelling, and important book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Greg Grandin, author of <em>The Empire of Necessity</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Caitlin Fitz shows that U.S. observers&#x2019; attitude toward their fellow American Revolutionaries south of the Rio Grande was, above all, narcissistic. Her fast-paced narrative goes a long way toward explaining why, by the mid-20th century, the Americas&#x2019; first independent republic became the world&#x2019;s leading suppressor of anti-colonial revolts.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Woody Holton, author of <em>Unruly Americans and the Origins of the Constitution</em>, <em>Unruly Americans and the Origins of the Constitution</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Caitlin Fitz has written an eloquent account of how public opinion in the United States welcomed the revolutions of the South American republics, and how the United States became the first country in the world to recognize their independence. She vividly describes the individual experiences of men and women, whites and blacks, politicians, intellectuals, and just plain folk.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Daniel Walker Howe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In a rip-roaring narrative, Caitlin Fitz tells the stunning story of camaraderie across the Americas in an era of revolutions. She shows that people of the United States took a generous, if self-congratulatory, delight in republican brotherhood in what was truly a revolutionary age, as well as how this shared idealism was forgotten in subsequent decades of division and nationalism.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kathleen DuVal, author of <em>Independence Lost: Lives on the Edge of the American Revolution</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Caitlin Fitz's superb study beautifully tells a story of persisting American egalitarian ideals coming under fire from an emerging cotton slaveocracy. With her meticulous research and trenchant prose, Fitz sends familiar preconceptions and pieties tumbling, and offers a new frame for understanding early American politics. With that, she takes her place at the forefront of an exciting, rising generation of American historians.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sean Wilentz, author of <em>The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Readable and groundbreaking, this work will be cited by scholars and enjoyed by general readers for years to come.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Rodriguez, <em>Library Journal</em></strong></p><h2>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy: Pretty Good Privacy</h2><p><p>Use of the Internet is expanding beyond anyone's expectations. As corporations, government offices, and ordinary citizens begin to rely on the information highway to conduct business, they are realizing how important it is to protect their communications -- both to keep them a secret from prying eyes and to ensure that they are not altered during transmission. Encryption, which until recently was an esoteric field of interest only to spies, the military, and a few academics, provides a mechanism for doing this.PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy, is a free and widely available encryption program that lets you protect files and electronic mail. Written by Phil Zimmermann and released in 1991, PGP works on virtually every platform and has become very popular both in the U.S. and abroad. Because it uses state-of-the-art public key cryptography, PGP can be used to authenticate messages, as well as keep them secret. With PGP, you can digitally "sign" a message when you send it. By checking the digital signature at the other end, the recipient can be sure that the message was not changed during transmission and that the message actually came from you.PGP offers a popular alternative to U.S. government initiatives like the Clipper Chip because, unlike Clipper, it does not allow the government or any other outside agency access to your secret keys.<i>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy</i> by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical user's guide and a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy. Part I, "PGP Overview," introduces PGP and the cryptography that underlies it. Part II, "Cryptography History and Policy," describes the history of PGP -- its personalities, legal battles, and other intrigues; it also provides background on the battles over public key cryptography patents and the U.S. government export restrictions, and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free speech. Part III, "Using PGP," describes how to use PGP: protecting files and email, creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing keys, and using key servers. Part IV, "Appendices," describes how to obtain PGP from Internet sites, how to install it on PCs, UNIX systems, and the Macintosh, and other background information. The book also contains a glossary, a bibliography, and a handy reference card that summarizes all of the PGP commands, environment variables, and configuration variables.</p></p><p>If you&#39;re concerned about the security of personal information on your computer--or in your e-mail--get PGP using this book. Garfinkel&#39;s guide to PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption software is a comprehensive guide to secure encryption for everyone and anyone. So much so that even Phil Zimmerman, who created PGP, said he learned new things from this book. But more than that, it takes you behind the scenes into the fascinating history and workings of the great intellectual adventure story of cryptography. This book is a fascinating read as well as a top-notch guide, and is needed now more than ever.<p>Simson Garfinkel, CISSP, is a journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security.

Another Great Depression? Not quite. Noted economist and China expert Michael Pettis argues instead that we are undergoing a critical rebalancing of the world economies. Debunking popular misconceptions, Pettis shows that severe trade imbalances spurred on the recent financial crisis and were the result of unfortunate policies that distorted the savings and consumption patterns of certain nations. Pettis examines the reasons behind these destabilizing policies, and he predicts severe economic dislocations--a lost decade for China, the breaking of the Euro, and a receding of the U.S. dollar&#x2015;that will have long-lasting effects.</p><p>Pettis explains how China has maintained massive&#x2015;but unsustainable&#x2015;investment growth by artificially lowering the cost of capital. He discusses how Germany is endangering the Euro by favoring its own development at the expense of its neighbors. And he looks at how the U.S. dollar's role as the world's reserve currency burdens America's economy. Although various imbalances may seem unrelated, Pettis shows that all of them&#x2015;including the U.S. consumption binge, surging debt in Europe, China's investment orgy, Japan's long stagnation, and the commodity boom in Latin America&#x2015;are closely tied together, and that it will be impossible to resolve any issue without forcing a resolution for all.</p><p>Demonstrating how economic policies can carry negative repercussions the world over, <i>The Great Rebalancing</i> sheds urgent light on our globally linked economic future.</p></p><p><p>"Through the past decade of China's financial and strategic emergence, Michael Pettis has been a source of unfailing common sense about the possibilities and limitations of the Chinese model. Now he has put his analysis and recommendations into one concise book. I highly recommend reading and reconsulting his book to put the daily flow of China news into perspective."<b>--James Fallows, author of <i>China Airborne</i></b></p><p>"This is a brilliant book, one that absolutely must be read by all who are concerned with globalization's future. Michael Pettis debunks the reigning conventional wisdom about international trade, finance, and globalization, and provides the most clear-eyed, unbiased, and unvarnished insights into how the Chinese economy works. From Chinese savers to Greek debtors to American bankers, Pettis shows how we are all connected--and what to prepare for on the road ahead."<b>--Clyde Prestowitz, author of <i>The Betrayal of American Prosperity</i></b></p><p>"Michael Pettis has written an essential guide to the macroeconomic imbalances that bedevil today's global economy. We ignore his message at our peril."<b>--Dani Rodrik, author of T<i>he Globalization Paradox</i></b></p><p>"This is a profoundly interesting exploration of the causes of the trade and capital imbalances that produced the 2008 financial crisis. Michael Pettis argues that the structural gap between China's domestic consumption and production is the central reason for its pursuit of export-led growth through currency undervaluation. His analysis focuses valuable attention on the deep domestic reforms required in all the major trading countries for the 'great rebalancing' of their international accounts--and the avoidance of continuing crises."<b>--Robert Skidelsky, author of <i>Keynes: The Return of the Master</i></b></p><b>Michael Pettis</b> is professor of finance and economics at Peking University, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment, and a widely read commentator on China, Europe, and the global economy.

Here, Peter Elbow emphasizes that the essential activities underlying good writing and the essential exercises promoting it are really not difficult at all. Employing a cookbook approach, Elbow provides the reader (and writer) with various recipes: for getting words down on paper, for revising, for dealing with an audience, for getting feedback on a piece of writing, and still other recipes for approaching the mystery of power in writing. In a new introduction, he offers his reflections on the original edition, discusses the responses from people who have followed his techniques, how his methods may differ from other processes, and how his original topics are still pertinent to todays writer.</p><p>Whatever your reason for writing, Peter Elbow has a "recipe" to guide you. A longtime proponent of "freewriting" (writing without stopping, for a preset amount of time), Elbow incorporates its use in a variety of ways. Have a limited amount of time? Spend half of it freewriting and half of it cleaning up your prose. Got all the time in the world (and only a vague sense of what you want to say)? Freewrite, then focus, then freewrite, then focus, repeatedly, until you get "a trustworthy vision of your final piece of writing." Elbow offers a plethora of prompts for priming the creative pump, as well as several ways to revise the piece of writing that results: thorough revising, revising with feedback, cutting and pasting, proofreading, and the like. He pays close attention to the ways in which focusing on an audience can assist or interfere in the writing process, including a terrific chapter on the strangeness of writing for teachers, in which "your task is usually to explain what you are still engaged in trying to understand to someone who understands it better." And he provides an excellent section on how to solicit the kind of feedback you want. Though it is a new edition of a 1981 book, there is nothing tired about <i>Writing with Power</i>: it provides many tools to help a writer feel empowered throughout the writing process. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><br><strong>Peter Elbow</strong> is Professor of English and Director of the writing program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.<br></p><h2>Methods in Psychological Research</h2><p>This interactive and highly applied text engages students with a rich mix of pedagogy (including unique FAQs and FYIs), a casual reader-friendly writing style, and examples of real psychological research from both research literature and student research projects.

Davidson (Cultural Memory in the Present)</h2><p>In this book of brilliantly erudite and precise discussions, Pierre Hadot explains that for the Ancients philosophy was not reducible to the building of a theoretical system: it was above all a choice about how to live one's life. One of the most influential historians of ancient philosophy in the world today, Hadot is adept at using ancient philosophers to illuminate the relevance of their ideas to contemporary life. In this book, which is an ideal introduction to Hadot's more scholarly <i>What is Ancient Philosophy?</i>, we learn that to be an Epicurean is not merely to think like one; it is to adopt a way of living where limiting desires is the condition for happiness. Being an Aristotelian, similarly, is to choose a life that involves contemplation, and being a Cynic is to follow Diogenes in his refusal of quotidian convention and the mentality of ordinary people. If so many Ancient philosophers founded schools, Hadot explains, it was precisely because they were proposing how to live life on a daily basis. We learn here that the history of philosophy has been something more than just that of a discourse. The founding texts of Greek philosophy, after all, were notes taken from oral exercises undertaken in concrete circumstances and contexts, most often a dialogue between students and specific interlocutors who meant to shed light on their students' real existence. The immense contribution of this book, which also traces Hadot's own personal itinerary in a touching manner, is to remind us, through direct language and numerous examples, what the theoretical aspect of philosophy often masks: its vital and existential dimensions.</p><p>Pierre Hadot is Professor Emeritus at the Coll�ge de France, where he held the Chair of the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought. Most of his major works have been translated into English, including <i>Philosophy as a Way of Life, What is Ancient Philosophy?</i> (1995), and <i>The Veil of Isis</i> (2006). His most recent book is <i>N'oublie pas de vivre. Goethe et la tradition des exercices spirituels</i> (2008). Arnold I. Davidson is Robert O. Anderson Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago and Professor of the History of Political Philosophy at the University of Pisa. He has written widely on contemporary French philosophy, is the English language series editor of Michel Foucault's courses at the Coll�ge de France, and is the author of <i>The Emergence of Sexuality</i> (2001). Jeannie Carlier is Professor at the �cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales. She has published essays on philosophy and religious practices in late antiquity and is a specialist in Neoplatonism."If your own experience of 'Philosophy 101' way back when was just shy of miserable, disconnected from the daily or generally incoherent&#x2015;gridlocked, for instance, in self-serving terms&#x2015;here, in <i>The Present Alone Is Our Happiness: Conversations with Jeannie Cartier and Arnold I. Davidson</i>, a good-souled man&#x2015;Hadot himself&#x2015;winks. He seems to say, 'Here's what happened, and here's why philosophy really is for you.' And if you are a teacher or a pedagogue, it's for you all the more." (<i>Teachers College Record</i>)<br><br>"Hadot's refreshing efforts to free philosophy and its history from the sterile constraints of abstract theorizing and academic specialization find a lively and productive outlet in the interviews collected here. Introduced by Jeannie Carlier, a French scholar of Neo-platonic religious thought and friend of Hadot, and conducted in turns by Carlier and Arnold Davidson, the American philosopher and intellectual historian most responsible for the introduction and dissemination of Hadot's work in English-speaking contexts, these conversations explore in depth and varied detail both the personal and the intellectual development of a scholar whose own work insists above all that the personal or existential cannot rightly or fruitfully be separated from the intellectual or philosophical. Enacting the kind of dialogue that Hadot believes essential to any philosophy that would constitute a living relation between persons rather than an abstract relation to ideas, these interviews could not find a more suitable subject." (Thomas A. Carlson, University of California <i>Santa Barbara</i>)<br><br>"There is much here that could affirm and inform a philosophical counseling practice, both in attitude and content. There is much here to remind ourselves of the importance of spiritual or philosophical exercises in our own trying times."

In <em>The Alps</em>, Stephen O&#x2019;Shea takes readers up and down these majestic mountains, battling his own fear of heights to journey through a 500-mile arc across France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.</p><p>O&#x2019;Shea, whose style has been hailed for its &#x201c;engaging combination of candid first-person travel writing and absorbing historical narrative&#x201d; (<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>), whisks readers along more than 2,000 years of Alpine history. As he travels pass-by-pass through the mountains, he tells great stories of those (real and imagined) who have passed before him, from Hannibal to Hitler, Frankenstein&#x2019;s monster to Sherlock Holmes, Napoleon to Nietzsche, William Tell to James Bond. He explores the circumstances behind Hannibal and his elephants&#x2019; famous crossing in 218 BCE; he reveals how the Alps have profoundly influenced culture from <em>Heidi</em> to <em>The Sound of Music</em>; and he visits iconic sites, including the Reichenbach Falls, where Arthur Conan Doyle staged Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s death scene with Professor Moriarty; Caporetto, the bloody site of the Italians&#x2019; retreat in World War I; and the Eagle&#x2019;s Nest, Hitler&#x2019;s aerie of a vacation home.</p><p>O&#x2019;Shea delves into Alpine myths and legends, such as the lopsided legs of the dahu, the fictitious goatlike creature of the mountains, and reveals why the beloved St. Bernard dog is so often depicted with a cask hanging below its neck.

Death in Venice, Thomas Mann&#39;s intensely moving elegy for a man trapped between myth and modernity, was written at the peak of his powers.</p><p>Thomas Mann was born in 1875 in Germany. He was only twenty-five when his first novel, <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, was published. In 1924, <i>The Magic Mountain</i> was published, and, five years later, Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he left Germany for good in 1933 to live in Switzerland and then in California, where he wrote <i>Doctor Faustus</i> (first published in the United States in 1948). Thomas Mann died in 1955.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i><i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>It was the nurse's fault. In vain Frau Consul Friedemann, when the matter was first suspected, had solemnly urged her to relinquish so heinous a vice; in vain she had dispensed to her daily a glass of red wine in addition to her nourishing stout. It suddenly came to light that the girl had actually sunk so low as to drink the methylated spirits intended for the coffee machine; and before a replacement for her had arrived, before she could be sent away, the accident had happened. One day, when little Johannes was about a month old, his mother and three adolescent sisters returned from a walk to find that he had fallen from the swaddling table and was lying on the floor making a horribly faint whimpering noise, with the nurse standing by looking stupidly down at him.<br><br>The doctor's face, as he carefully but firmly probed the limbs of the crooked, twitching little creature, wore an exceedingly serious expression; the three girls stood in a corner sobbing, and Frau Friedemann prayed aloud in her mortal anguish.<br><br>Even before the baby was born it had been the poor woman's lot to see her husband, the consul for the Netherlands, reft from her by an illness both sudden and acute, and she was still too broken in spirit to be even capable of hoping that the life of her little Johannes might be spared. Two days later, however, the doctor squeezed her hand encouragingly and pronounced that there was now absolutely no question of any immediate danger; above all, the slight concussion of the brain had completely cleared up. This, he explained, was obvious if one looked at the child's eyes; there had been a vacant stare in them at first which had now quite disappeared . . . "Of course," he added, "we must wait and see how things go on&#x2014;and we must hope for the best, you know, hope for the best . . ."<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br></i><br><br>The gray gabled house in which Johannes Friedemann grew up was near the north gate of the old, scarcely middle-sized merchant city. Its front door opened onto a spacious stone-paved hall, from which a stair with white wooden banisters led to the upper floors. On the first was the living room with its walls papered in a faded landscape pattern, and its heavy mahogany table draped in crimson plush, with high-backed chairs and settees standing stiffly round it.<br><br>Here, as a child, he would often sit by the window, where there was always a fine display of flowers; he would sit on a little stool at his mother's feet, listening perhaps as she told him some wonderful story, gazing at her smooth gray hair and her kind gentle face, and breathing in the slight fragrance of scent that always hung about her. Or perhaps he would get her to show him the portrait of his father, an amiable gentleman with gray side-whiskers. He was (said his mother) now living in heaven, waiting for them all to join him there.<br><br>Behind the house was a little garden, and during the summer they would spend a good deal of time in it, notwithstanding the almost perpetual sickly sweet exhalations from a nearby sugar refinery. In the garden stood an old gnarled walnut tree, and in its shade little Johannes would often sit on a low wooden stool cracking nuts, while Frau Friedemann and her three daughters, now grown up, sat together in a gray canvas tent. But Frau Friedemann would often raise her eyes from her needlework and glance tenderly and sadly across at her son.<br><br>Little Johannes was no beauty, with his pigeon chest, his steeply humped back and his disproportionately long skinny arms, and as he squatted there on his stool, nimbly and eagerly cracking his nuts, he was certainly a strange sight. But his hands and feet were small and neatly shaped, and he had great liquid brown eyes, a sensitive mouth and soft light brown hair. In fact, although his face sat so pitifully low down between his shoulders, it could nevertheless almost have been called beautiful.<br><i><br>Chapter Three<br></i><br><br>When he was seven he was sent to school, and now the years passed uniformly and rapidly. Every day, walking past the gabled houses and shops with the quaintly solemn gait that deformed people often have, he made his way to the old schoolhouse with its Gothic vaulting; and at home, when he had done his homework, he would perhaps read some of his beautiful books with their brightly colored illustrations, or potter about in the garden, while his sisters kept house for their ailing mother. The girls also went to parties, for the Friedemanns moved in the best local society; but unfortunately none of the three had yet married, for their family fortune was by no means large and they were distinctly plain.<br><br>Johannes, too, occasionally got an invitation from one or other of his contemporaries, but it was no great pleasure for him to associate with them. He was unable to join in their games, and since they always treated him with embarrassed reserve, it was impossible for any real companionship to develop.<br><br>Later there came a time when he would often hear them discuss certain matters in the school yard; wide-eyed and attentive, he would listen in silence as they talked of their passions for this little girl or that. Such experiences, he decided, obviously engrossing though they were for the others, belonged like gymnastics and ball games to the category of things for which he was not suited. This was at times a rather saddening thought; but after all, he had long been accustomed to going his own way and not sharing the interests of other people.<br><br>It nevertheless came to pass&#x2014;he was sixteen years old at the time&#x2014;that he found himself suddenly enamored of a girl of his own age. She was the sister of one of his classmates, a blond, exuberant creature whom he had met at her brother's house. He felt a strange uneasiness in her company, and the studied self-conscious cordiality with which she too treated him saddened him profoundly.<br><br>One summer afternoon when he was taking a solitary walk along the promenade outside the old city wall, he heard whispered words being exchanged behind a jasmine bush. He cautiously peeped through the branches, and there on a seat sat this girl and a tall red-haired boy whom he knew very well by sight; the boy's arm was round her and he was pressing a kiss on her lips, which with much giggling she reciprocated. When Johannes had seen this he turned on his heel and walked softly away.<br><br>His head had sunk lower than ever between his shoulders, his hands were trembling and a sharp, biting pain rose from his chest and seemed to choke him. But he swallowed it down, and resolutely drew himself up as straight as he could. "Very well," he said to himself, "that is over. I will never again concern myself with such things. To the others they mean joy and happiness, but to me they can only bring grief and suffering. I am done with it all. It is finished for me. Never again."<br><br>The decision was a relief to him. He had made a renunciation, a renunciation forever. He went home and took up a book or played the violin, which he had learned to do despite his deformity.<br><i><br>Chapter Four<br></i><br><br>At seventeen he left school to go into business, like everyone else of his social standing, and he became an apprentice in Herr Schlievogt's big timber firm down by the river. They treated him with special consideration, he for his part was amiable and cooperative, and the years passed by in a peaceful and well-ordered manner. But in his twenty-first year his mother died after a long illness.<br><br>This was a great sorrow for Johannes Friedemann, and one that he long cherished. He savored this sorrow, he surrendered himself to it as one surrenders oneself to a great happiness, he nourished it with innumerable memories from his childhood and made the most of it, as his first major experience.<br><br>Is not life in itself a thing of goodness, irrespective of whether the course it takes for us can be called a "happy" one? Johannes Friedemann felt that this was so, and he loved life. He had renounced the greatest happiness it has to offer, but who shall say with what passionate care he cultivated those pleasures that were accessible to him? A walk in springtime through the parks outside the town, the scent of a flower, the song of a bird&#x2014;surely these were things to be thankful for?<br><br>He also well understood that a capacity for the enjoyment of life presupposes education, indeed that education always adds at once to that capacity, and he took pains to educate himself. He loved music and attended any concerts that were given in the town. And although it was uncommonly odd to watch him play, he did himself become not a bad violinist and took pleasure in every beautiful and tender note he was able to draw from his instrument. And by dint of much reading he had in the course of time acquired a degree of literary taste which in that town was probably unique. He was versed in all the latest publications both in Germany and abroad, he knew how to savor the exquisite rhythms of a poem, he could appreciate the subtle atmosphere of a finely written short story . . . One might indeed almost say that he was an epicurean.<br><br>He came to see that there is nothing that cannot be enjoyed and that it is almost absurd to distinguish between happy and unhappy experiences. He accepted all his sensations and moods as they came to him, he welcomed and cultivated them, whether they were sad or glad: even his unfulfilled wishes, even his heart's longing. It was precious to him for its own sake, and he would tell himself that if it ever came to fulfillment the best part of the pleasure would be over. Is not the sweet pain of vague desires and hopes on a still spring evening richer in delight than any fulfillment the summer could bring? Ah yes, little Herr Friedemann was an epicurean and no mistake.<br><br>This was something of which the people who passed him in the street, greeting him with that mixture of cordiality and pity to which he had so long been accustomed, were doubtless unaware. They did not know that this unfortunate crippl...</p><h2>MONEY MATTERS!

Furthermore, we are as haunted by the failures of utopian enterprise as we are inspired by the desire to repair the failed and build the new. Contemporary art reflects this general ambivalence. The utopian impulse informs politically activist and relational art, practices that fuse elements of art, design, and architecture, and collaborative projects aspiring to progressive social or political change. Two other tendencies have emerged in recent art: a looking backward to investigate the utopian elements of previous eras, and the imaginative modeling of alternative worlds as intimations of possibility. This anthology contextualizes these utopian currents in relation to political thought, viewing the utopian as a key term in the artistic lineage of modernity. It illuminates how the exploration of utopian themes in art today contributes to our understanding of contemporary cultures, and the possibilities for shaping their futures.</p><p><b>Artistis surveyed include<br></b>Joseph Beuys, Paul Chan, Guy Debord, Jeremy Deller, Liam Gillick, Antony Gormley, Dan Graham, Thomas Hirschhorn, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Paul McCarthy, Constant A.

Some of the authors project brilliant visions of the future, others seek to examine the contemporary blockages on the utopian impulse, while most investigate the confusion of what makes (or does not make) something utopian within the context of art.

Joaquin is central to the literature of the Philippines. To read Joaquin is to gain access to how three cultures intersected in the Pacific, mixing explosively with blood, violence, and fantasy in ways that foreshadow what is happening in the Philippines today." <br>&#x2014;<b>Viet Thanh Nguyen</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Sympathizer</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Nick Joaquin was such a presence in my childhood. I remember having a collection of Joaquin's stories for children in my personal library.

This book brilliantly captures the singular genius of Nick Joaquin, and will seduce readers everywhere who are meeting this giant of Philippine literature for the first time.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<b>Mia Alvar</b>, PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>In the Country</i>&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;One cannot overstate what Nick Joaquin is to Philippine literature.&nbsp; Writing in English with the melody of&nbsp;Spanish and Tagalog, Joaquin was the first Filipino writer to focus on the impossible contradictions of a tribal civilization overlain by Spanish and American world views.&nbsp; And because that tribal civilization was woman-centered, Joaquin&#x2019;s heroines are as complex, romantic and&nbsp;defiant as Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><b>&#x2014;Ninotchka Rosca</b>, American Book Award-winning author of <i>Twice Blessed</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nick Joaquin was both a brilliant poet and intense chronicler of doubleness that is a defining attribute of postcoloniality, in his case a Hispanicized Philippines, complicated by Anglo American colonial rule. Underneath his use of English one senses the patriarchal tone of Spanish and the feminist susurrations of Tagalog. Hence, Joaquin&#x2019;s world, particularly in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino, </i>is one where remembering offers both solace and grief, and a subtle critique of empire. An exemplar of postcolonial literature at its best, Joaquin moves us with his empathetic depictions of a divided consciousness. Penguin&#x2019;s reissue of his works is a benediction and cause for celebration.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<b>Luis H. Francia</b>, PEN Open Book Award-winning author of <i>Eye of the Fish: A Personal Archipelago</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Drafted in an age of strongmen, during the first two decades of the country&#x2019;s postcolonial period between 1946 and 1965, the 11 works collected in this volume &#x2013; 10 stories and a play &#x2013; read as feminist. (...) In Joaquin&#x2019;s worlds, female power is cause for awe. (...) It is rare for any woman to be granted some clarity in a desperate time &#x2013; to be described as anything but hysterical. But this is Joaquin&#x2019;s way: He writes sentences that are precise yet lyrical, tiny emotional ramps leading us to the truth &#x2013; to the original wound &#x2013; with dignity. (...) &#x201c;There is a constant duality to Joaquin&#x2019;s world &#x2013; war and resistance, the hopeful and the tragic, the desperate and the despot. Joaquin was an essential voice in Filipino culture until his death in 2004, and this volume reminds us, as the historian Vicente L. Rafael states in his introduction, &#x2018;of the need to endure the sense of loss amid the ruins upon ruins that remain.&#x2019; With the new ruins of President Rodrigo Duterte&#x2019;s vicious antidrug campaign on the Philippines&#x2019; streets, such endurance takes on new urgency.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Melissa Chadburn, The New York Times Book Review</b><br><br>&#x201c;A standout collection (...) a transporting read, and a fierce elegy for a past that never was.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>NPR</b><br><br>&#x201c;Steeped in Filipino history and culture, Joaquin's work is a welcome discovery.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Kirkus Reviews</b></p><h2>Collector's Guide to Antique Radios: Identification &amp; Values (4th ed)</h2><p>Including complete description and over 600 color photos, this new fourth edition covers well over 5,000 models of radios.

Taking seriously Wittgenstein's remark that "philosophy ought really to be written only as a form of poetry," Perloff begins by discussing Wittgenstein the "poet." What we learn is that the poetics of everyday life is anything but banal.<br><br>"This book has the lucidity and the intelligence we have come to expect from Marjorie Perloff.&#x2014;Linda Munk, <i>American Literature</i><br><br>"[Perloff] has brilliantly adapted Wittgenstein's conception of meaning and use to an analysis of contemporary language poetry."&#x2014;Linda Voris, <i>Boston Review</i><br><br>"<i>Wittgenstein's Ladder</i> offers significant insights into the current state of poetry, literature, and literary study. Perloff emphasizes the vitality of reading and thinking about poetry, and the absolute necessity of pushing against the boundaries that define and limit our worlds."&#x2014;David Clippinger, <i>Chicago Review</i><br><br>"Majorie Perloff has done more to illuminate our understanding of twentieth century poetic language than perhaps any other critic. . . . Entertaining, witty, and above all highly original."&#x2014;Willard Bohn, <i>Sub-Stance</i><br></p><p>Austere and uncompromising, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had no use for the avant-garde art works of his own time. He refused to formulate an aesthetic, declaring that one can no more define the &#34;beautiful&#34; than determine &#34;what sort of coffee tastes good&#34;. And yet many of the writers of our time have understood, as academic theorists generally have not, that Wittgenstein is &#34;their&#34; philosopher. How do we resolve this paradox? Marjorie Perloff, our foremost critic of twentieth-century poetry, argues that Wittgenstein has provided writers with a radical new aesthetic, a key to recognizing the inescapable strangeness of ordinary language. Wittgenstein&#39;s ladder is an apt figure for this radical aesthetic, and not just in its ordinariness as an object. The movement &#34;up&#34; this ladder can never be more than what Wittgenstein&#39;s contemporary, Gertrude Stein, called &#34;Beginning again and again&#34;. Wittgenstein shows us, too, that we cannot climb the same ladder twice: the use of language, the context in which words and sentences appear, defines their meaning, which changes with every repetition. Wittgenstein&#39;s aesthetic brooks no theory, no essentialism, no metalanguage - only a practice, a mode of operation, fragmentary and elliptical.<strong>Marjorie Perloff</strong> is professor of English emerita at Stanford University and the Florence R.

This book remedied that need by offering a carefully thought-out, graduated approach to point set topology at the undergraduate level.<br>To make the book as accessible as possible, the author approaches topology from a geometric and axiomatic standpoint; geometric, because most students come to the subject with a good deal of geometry behind them, enabling them to use their geometric intuition; axiomatic, because it parallels the student's experience with modern algebra, and keeps the book in harmony with current trends in mathematics.<br>After a discussion of such preliminary topics as the algebra of sets, Euler-Venn diagrams and infinite sets, the author takes up basic definitions and theorems regarding topological spaces (Chapter 1). The second chapter deals with continuous functions (mappings) and homeomorphisms, followed by two chapters on special types of topological spaces (varieties of compactness and varieties of connectedness). Chapter 5 covers metric spaces.<br>Since basic point set topology serves as a foundation not only for functional analysis but also for more advanced work in point set topology and algebraic topology, the author has included topics aimed at students with interests other than analysis. Moreover, Dr. Baum has supplied quite detailed proofs in the beginning to help students approaching this type of axiomatic mathematics for the first time. Similarly, in the first part of the book problems are elementary, but they become progressively more difficult toward the end of the book. References have been supplied to suggest further reading to the interested student.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>How Not to Write a Novel: 200 Classic Mistakes and How to Avoid Them--A Misstep-by-Misstep Guide</h2><p><blockquote><p>"What do you think of my fiction book writing?" the aspiring novelist extorted. </p><p>"Darn," the editor hectored, in turn.

Rediscovered in the 1960s, this brief, beautiful novel is considered a landmark of early feminism. It is the story of Edna Pontellier, a twenty-eight-year-old wife and mother of two who&#x2014;with devastating consequences&#x2014;rejects her conventional married life for a transgressive path of self-discovery.<br><br> Edna is vacationing with her husband and children on the Louisiana Gulf Coast when she meets and falls in love with the passionate, impulsive Robert Lebrun. Afterward, Edna can no longer find meaning and satisfaction in her comfortable domestic life and moves out, alone. Her tragic quest for personal, creative, and erotic freedom is at the heart of this now-classic novel which captures women&#x2019;s desires with extraordinary frankness, sympathy, and intensity.&nbsp;<br> <b><br>The Modern Library Torchbearers series features women who wrote on their own terms, with boldness, creativity, and a spirit of resistance.</b></p><p>Born and raised in St. Louis,<b>&nbsp;Kate Chopin</b>&nbsp;(1850&#x2013;1904) married the son of a cotton grower and moved to Louisiana. A mother of six by the age of twenty-eight and a widow at thirty-two, she turned to writing to support her young family, publishing two novels and almost one hundred short stories.THE AWAKENING<br> &nbsp;<br> I<br> &nbsp;<br> A GREEN AND yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept repeating over and over:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Allez vous-en! Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody understood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort, arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust. He walked down the gallery and across the narrow &#x201c;bridges&#x201d; which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated before the door of the main house. The parrot and the mocking-bird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building was called &#x201c;the house,&#x201d; to distinguish it from the cottages. The chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from &#x201c;Zampa&#x201d; upon the piano. Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Ch�ni�re Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the water-oaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's two children were there&#x2014;sturdy little fellows of four and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!&#x201d; exclaimed Mr. Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the morning seemed long to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are burnt beyond recognition,&#x201d; he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them critically, drawing up her lawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come go along, Lebrun,&#x201d; he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,&#x201d; instructed her husband as he prepared to leave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here, take the umbrella,&#x201d; she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Coming back to dinner?&#x201d; his wife called after him. He halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein's and the size of &#x201c;the game.&#x201d; He did not say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Songwriting For Dummies?</h2><p>Learn to write songs like a pro <p>Want to know how to make it as a songwriter? <i>Songwriting For Dummies, 2nd Edition</i> gives you a chance to learn from the best.

The central motif of Melville's last and most `modern' novel can be seen as a symbol of American cultural history.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Long considered the author's strangest novel, <i>The Confidence-Man </i>is a comic allegory aimed at the optimism and materialism of mid-eighteenth-century America. A mysterious shape-changing Confidence-Man approaches passengers on a Mississippi steamboat and, winning over the (not quite innocent) victims with his charm, urges them to implicitly trust in the cosmos, in nature, and even in human nature-with predictable results.<br><br><i>The Confidence-Man</i> represented a departure for Melville, a satirical and socially acute work that was to be a further step away from his sea novels. Yet it confused and angered reviewers who preferred to pigeonhole him as an adventure writer. Some have argued the book was a joke on the readers loyal to his sea stories, but if so, it backfired. Dismissed by critics as unreadable, and an undoubted financial failure, <i>The Confidence-Man</i>'s cold reception undermined Melville's belief in his ability to make a living writing works that were both popular and profound, and he soon gave up fiction. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that critics rediscovered the book and praised its wit, stunningly modern technique, and wry view that life may be just a cosmic con game.&#34;In &#34;The Confidence-Man,&#34; writes John Bryant in his Introduction, &#34;Melville found a way to render our tragic sense of self and society through the comic strategies of the confidence game. He puts the reader in the game to play its parts and to contemplate the inconsistencies of its knaves and fools.&#34; Set on a Mississippi steamer on April Fool&#39;s Day and populated by a series of shape-shifting con men, &#34;The Confidence-Man is a challenging metaphysical and ethical exploration of antebellum American society. Set from the first American edition of 1857, this Modern Library paperback includes an Appendix with Bryant&#39;s innovative &#34;fluid text&#34; analysis of early manuscript fragments from Melville&#39;s novel.</p><h2>King Lear (Barnes &amp; Noble Shakespeare)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RKing Lear&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RWilliam Shakespeare&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Shakespeare&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R series.&nbsp; This unique series features newly edited texts prepared by leading scholars from America and Great Britain, in collaboration with one of the world&#x2019;s foremost Shakespeare authorities, &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RDavid Scott Kastan&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R of Columbia University.

Not only does it introduce with remarkable clarity the ideas and issues that are the stuff of legal education; it brings alive the anxiety and competiveness--with others and, even more, with oneself--that set the tone in this crucible of character building. Turow's multidimensional delving into his protagonists' psyches and his marvelous gift for suspense prefigure the achievements of his celebrated first novel, <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, one of the best-selling and most talked about books of 1987.<br><br>Each September, a new crop of students enter Harvard Law School to begin an intense, often grueling, sometimes harrowing year of introduction to the law. Turow's group of One Ls are fresh, bright, ambitious, and more than a little daunting. Even more impressive are the faculty: Perini, the dazzling, combative professor of contracts, who presents himself as the students' antagonist in their struggle to master his subject; Zechman, the reserved professor of torts who seems so indecisive the students fear he cannot teach; and Nicky Morris, a young, appealing man who stressed the humanistic aspects of law.<br><br>Will the One Ls survive? Will they excel? Will they make the<i> Law Review</i>, the outward and visible sign of success in this ultra-conservative microcosm? With remarkable insight into both his fellows and himself, Turow leads us through the ups and downs, the small triumphs and tragedies of the year, in an absorbing and throught-provoking narrative that teaches the reader not only about law school and the law but about the human beings who make them what they are.<br><br>In the new afterword for this edition of <i>One L</i>, the author looks back on law school from the perspective of ten years' work as a lawyer and offers some suggestions for reforming legal education.<br><br></p><p><br>Scott Turow, a graduate of Amherst College and Harvard Law School, is the author of four worldwide bestselling: <i>Presumed Innocent, The Burden of Proof, Pleading Guilty,</i> and<i> The Laws of Our Fathers</i>.

Published while he was still attending Harvard Law School, it tells the story of his first year (with names changed to protect privacy). Holter Graham reads the memoir with a youthful voice that captures all the wonder, surprise, and indignation that the na�ve Turow experienced in 1975-76. Turow's writing reveals self-deprecating humor, for example, his comment that a prof's brief "resembled the brief I had written only in that it was written on paper." We hear Turow's older, more jaded, and perhaps wiser voice as he introduces the 1977 book and closes it with comments and an interview.

The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply &#34;optimism&#34;) by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide&#39;s slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, &#34;we must cultivate our garden&#34;, in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, &#34;all is for the best&#34; in the &#34;best of all possible worlds&#34;.Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clich�s, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years&#39; War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire&#39;s day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.As expected by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of na�vet�. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire&#39;s magnum opus and is often listed as part of the Western canon; it is arguably taught more than any other work of French literature. Martin Seymour-Smith has listed Candide as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written.</p><p>Political satire doesn't age well, but occasionally a diatribe contains enough art and universal mirth to survive long after its timeliness has passed. <i>Candide</i> is such a book. Penned by that Renaissance man of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, <i>Candide</i> is steeped in the political and philosophical controversies of the 1750s. But for the general reader, the novel's driving principle is clear enough: the idea (endemic in Voltaire's day) that we live in the best of all possible worlds, and apparent folly, misery and strife are actually harbingers of a greater good we cannot perceive, is hogwash.<p> Telling the tale of the good-natured but star-crossed Candide (think Mr. Magoo armed with deadly force), as he travels the world struggling to be reunited with his love, Lady Cunegonde, the novel smashes such ill-conceived optimism to splinters. Candide's tutor, Dr. Pangloss, is steadfast in his philosophical good cheer, in the face of more and more fantastic misfortune; Candide's other companions always supply good sense in the nick of time. Still, as he demolishes optimism, Voltaire pays tribute to human resilience, and in doing so gives the book a pleasant indomitability common to farce. Says one character, a princess turned one-buttocked hag by unkind Fate: "I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most melancholy propensities; for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one's very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?"<i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><p>In this new translation of Voltaire&#x2019;s best-known work, distinguished translator Burton Raffel captures the irreverent spirit of <i>Candide and </i>renders the novel in clear, vivacious English. Stylistically superior to all predecessors, Raffel&#x2019;s version now stands as the translation of choice for twenty-first-century readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Selected Poems</h2><p>Gathers ballads, and poems dealing with social reform, politics, and love, and provides a brief appreciation of her life and career</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

He devised survival strategies&#x2015;stamp collecting, watching soccer, and the like&#x2015;that served as screens to block out the increasingly oppressive world around him. Even before the events of 1938&#x2013;39, culminating in Kristallnacht, the family was convinced that they must leave the country. Gay describes the bravery and ingenuity of his father in working out this difficult emigration process, the courage of the non-Jewish friends who helped his family during their last bitter months in Germany, and the family&#x2019;s mounting panic as they witnessed the indifference of other countries to their plight and that of others like themselves. Gay&#x2019;s account&#x2015;marked by candor, modesty, and insight&#x2015;adds an important and curiously neglected perspective to the history of German Jewry.</p><p>Cultural historian Peter Gay (<i>The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud</i>, <i>Freud: A Life for Our Time</i>) applies his considerable analytic skills to his memoir of his early years as a Jew in 1930s Berlin. Light-haired, blue-eyed, and culturally assimilated, the Frohlich family, as they were then known, convinced themselves that, despite the growth spurt of the Nazi party, anti-Semitism was on the wane among the German populous. Gay recalls that his daily life was relatively unaffected by the Totalitarian regime. That is until 1933, when, according to law, he became a Jew overnight. Soon the family found their living quarters shrinking and their awareness of their plight growing (though no one could possibly conceive of what would come). Though still a boy, Gay remembers that "one of the greatest moments in my life" came when the German women's relay team dropped their baton at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Then came Kristallnacht, which crystallized the family's sublimated fears and precipitated their flight from their home. After a certain suspenseful series of necessary deceits and circuitous travels, the family began their new life in America--12-year-old Peter spoke barely a word of English. Now, decades later, Gay employs his new native tongue to uncover the psychological impulses that fed his parents' decision to stay in Berlin as long as they did and governed his own behavior as a boy. The result is credible answer to the question: How could they have stayed?<b>Peter Gay</b> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University and director of the Center for Scholars and Writers, New York Public Library.

It brings to life the legends of gods, asuras, sages and kings-all the while articulating the crucial ethical and philosophical tenets that underpin Hindu spiritualism. The narrative unfolds through a series of conversations and interconnected stories. We are told how the sage Vyasa was inspired by Narada to compose the Bhagavata Purana as a means to illumine the path to a spiritual life. We learn of the devotion of Prahlada, the austerity of Dhruva, and the blinding conceit of Daksha. Also recounted are tales of the many incarnations of Vishnu, especially Krishna, whom we see grow from a beloved and playful child to a fierce protector of the faithful.</p><p>Bibek Debroy is a renowned economist, scholar and translator.

Folktales about and exploration of the mystical meanings of the Hebrew Alphabet. Open the old prayerbook-like pages of <em>The Book of Letters</em> and you will enter a special world of sacred tradition and religious feeling.</p><p>More than just symbols, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet overflow with meanings and personalities of their own. Rabbi Kushner draws from ancient Judaic sources, weaving Talmudic commentary, Hasidic folktales and Kabbalistic mysteries around the letters.</p></p><p><i>The Book of Letters: A Mystical Alef-Bait</i> is written in English, but the format is classically Talmudic. The book opens from right to left, ending on the page where most readers are accustomed to beginning. Lawrence Kushner, a Massachusetts rabbi whose writings have helped restore a mystical dimension to popular Judaism in America, wrote <i>The Book of Letters</i> in beautiful calligraphy that is reproduced on every page of this finely bound edition. The text does not so much analyze or explain the letters of the Hebrew alphabet as <i>play</i> with them, teasing their forms and functions for hints of their significance. Noting that aleph, the unpronounceable first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is also the first letter of the names of the first man (Adam), the first Jew (Abraham), and the herald of the last man (Elijah), as well as the first letter of the first commandment, Kushner notes that "The most basic words there are begin with the most primal sound there is." <i>The Book of Letters</i> is full of seriously playful insights like this. It's a marvelous guide to meditation, a primer for students of Hebrew calligraphy, and a fun introduction to learning Hebrew. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>A book which is in love with Jewish letters. It gives us a feeling which the Kabbalists always knew that the letters of the alphabet are not just letters but symbols of our history, of our philosophy, and of the life of the Jewish people.

Examining the history of the laboratory, Peter J. T. Morris offers a unique way to look at the history of chemistry itself, showing how the development of the laboratory helped shape modern chemistry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Chemists, Morris shows, are one of the leading drivers of innovation in laboratory design and technology. He tells of fascinating lineages of invention and innovation, for instance, how the introduction of coal gas into Robert Wilhelm Bunsen&#x2019;s laboratory led to the eponymous burner, which in turn led to the development of atomic spectroscopy. Comparing laboratories across eras, from the furnace-centered labs that survived until the late eighteenth century to the cleanrooms of today, he shows how the overlooked aspects of science&#x2015;the architectural design and innovative tools that have facilitated its practice&#x2015;have had a profound impact on what science has been able to do and, ultimately, what we have been able to understand. &nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Peter J.

He demonstrates that many leading Darwinian biologists and social thinkers in Germany believed that Darwinism overturned traditional Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment ethics, especially the view that human life is sacred. Many of these thinkers supported moral relativism, yet simultaneously exalted evolutionary &#39;fitness&#39; (especially intelligence and health) to the highest arbiter of morality. Darwinism played a key role in the rise not only of eugenics, but also euthanasia, infanticide, abortion and racial extermination. This was especially important in Germany, since Hitler built his view of ethics on Darwinian principles, not on nihilism.</p><p>"This is one of the finest examples of intellectual history I have seen in a long while. It is insightful, thoughtful, informative, and highly readable. Rather than simply connecting the dots, so to speak, the author provides a sophisticated and nuanced examination of numerous German thinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who were influenced to one degree or another by Darwinist naturalism and their ideas, subtly drawing both distinctions and similarities and in the process telling a rich and colorful story.

Fenster, a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Society for Engineering Education, is co-author of a text on mechanics. </p>Preface to the Fourth EditionIntroduction<p>This text is a development of classroom notes prepared in connection with advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate courses in elasticity and the mechanics of solids. It is designed to satisfy the requirements of courses subsequent to an elementary treatment of the strength of materials. In addition to its applicability to aeronautical, civil, and mechanical engineering and to engineering mechanics curricula, the authors have endeavored to make the text useful to practicing engineers. Emphasis is given to numerical techniques (which lend themselves to computerization) in the solution of problems resisting analytical treatment. The stress placed on numerical solutions is not intended to deny the value of classical analysis, which is given a rather full treatment. It instead attempts to fill what the authors believe to be a void in the world of textbooks.</p><p>An effort has been made to present a balance between the theory necessary to gain insight into the mechanics, but which can often offer no more than crude approximations to real problems because of simplifications related to geometry and conditions of loading, and numerical solutions, which are so useful in presenting stress analysis in a more realistic setting. The authors have thus attempted to emphasize those aspects of theory and application that prepare a student for more advanced study or for professional practice in design and analysis.</p><p>The theory of elasticity plays three important roles in the text: It provides exact solutions where the configurations of loading and boundary are relatively simple; it provides a check on the limitations of the mechanics of materials approach; and it serves as the basis of approximate solutions employing numerical analysis.</p><p>To make the text as clear as possible, attention is given to the presentation of the fundamentals of the mechanics of materials. The physical significance of the solutions and practical applications are given emphasis. The authors have made a special effort to illustrate important principles and applications with numerical examples. Consistent with announced national policy, problems are included in the text in which the physical quantities are expressed in the International System of Units (SI). All important quantities are defined in both SI and U.S. Customary System of units. A sign convention, consistent with vector mechanics, is employed throughout for loads, internal forces, and stresses. This convention conforms to that used in most classical strength of materials and elasticity texts, as well as to that most often employed in the numerical analysis of complex structures.Text Arrangement</p><p>Because of the extensive subdivision into a variety of topics and the employment of alternative methods of analysis, the text should provide flexibility in the choice of assignments to cover courses of varying length and content. Most chapters are substantially self-contained. Hence, the order of presentation can be smoothly altered to meet an instructor's preference. It is suggested, however, that Chapters 1 and 2, which address the analysis of basic concepts, should be studied first. The emphasis placed on the treatment of two-dimensional problems in elasticity (Chapter 3) may differ according to the scope of the course.</p><p>This fourth edition of Advanced Strength and Applied Elasticity seeks to preserve the objectives and emphases of the previous editions. Every effort has been made to provide a more complete and current text through the inclusion of new material dealing with the fundamental principles of stress analysis: failure criteria; fracture mechanics; compound cylinders; numerical methods; energy and variational methods; buckling of stepped columns; and common shell types. The entire text has been reexamined and many improvements have been made throughout by a process of elimination and rearrangement. Some sections have been expanded to improve on previous expositions.</p><p>The references, provided as an aid to the student who wishes to pursue further certain aspects of a subject, have been updated and identified at the end of the text. I have resisted the temptation to increase the material covered except where absolutely necessary. However, it was considered desirable to add a number of illustrative examples and a large number of problems important in engineering practice and design. Most changes in subject-matter coverage were prompted by the suggestions of faculty familiar with earlier editions.</p><p>As before, it is hoped that I have maintained clarity of presentation, simplicity as the subject permits, unpretentious depth, an effort to encourage intuitive understanding, and a shunning of the irrelevant. In this context, as throughout, emphasis is placed on the use of fundamentals in order to build student understanding and an ability to solve the more complex problems.Supplement</p><p>The book is accompanied by a Solutions Manual available to instructors. It features complete solutions to all problems in the text. Answers to selected problems are given at the end of the book. <br></p></p><h2>Calling Cards: Uncover Your Calling</h2><p>Calling Cards are an interactive tool built to accompany the book <i>The Power of Purpose</i> and <i>Work Reimagined</i>.

In keeping with its long tradition, Fowler's gives comprehensive and practical advice on grammar, syntax, style, and choice of words. It gives a clear and authoritative picture of the English we use, and elucidates many scores of usage questions such as the split infinitive and the intricacies of political correctness. It gives in-depth coverage of both British and American English with reference to the English of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. The volume includes wide-ranging examples of usage from a broad selection of newspapers, journals, and books from across the globe, and features illustrative quotations from authors such as Agatha Christie, Chinua Achebe, Iris Murdoch, Harold Pinter, and Noel Coward.<br> <br> Based on the evidence and research of the Oxford Dictionaries Program, this is the most comprehensive and authoritative guide to usage available. The third edition of 1996 provided a complete revision and an expansion of the original text, bringing the book fully up to date on all matters of grammar, usage, syntax, and style. <strong>This is a reissue of the revised third edition of 1998, which includes a new Supplement and revised entries. Replaces isbn 0198602634.</strong></p><p>For generations, lovers of the English language have turned to trusty copies of <b>Fowler's</b> to settle nagging grammatical questions, or, for true hard-core language junkies, for the sheer fun of reading H. W. Fowler's classic outrage contained in entries on "Hackneyed Phrases" or "Pedantic-Humour Words." <p> <i>The New Fowler's Modern English Usage</i>, the first revision in more than 30 years, has not arrived without controversy. Some language (and Fowler) purists complain that the book is too liberal at times, noting that usage is common as opposed to correct. Those points are debatable, and, indeed, they're what makes the book's nearly 900 pages so interesting to peruse. The currency of the new <i>Fowler's</i> extends to, in the entry on "Vogue Words," such novelties as "couch potato," "flavour of the month," "on a roll," and the notorious "parameter."</p><br>The original 'Fowler' was <strong>Henry Watson Fowler</strong> (1858-1933), a teacher and writer. He was also the author, with his brother Francis, of <em>The King's English</em> (1906) and the first edition of the <em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em> (1911).<br> <br> <strong>Robert Burchfield</strong> (1923-2004), a New Zealander by birth, held the post of Chief Editor of Oxford English Dictionaries between 1971 and 1984 and was the Editor of the final volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary Supplements. He was also the editor of <em>The New Zealand Pocket Oxford Dictionary</em> (1986) and, with C. T. Onions and G. W. S.

After a passionate affair in his youth concludes with his face being burned by acid thrown by his lover&#x2019;s jealous fianc�, Meaume undertakes a lifetime of wandering, his psyche forever engraved by the memory of the woman who spurned him. With a face of boiled leather and a mind haunted by a nightmare of desire, he devotes himself to the black-and-white world of etchings and mezzotints, forsaking the paradise of color to engage in a science of shadows. This fragmented narrative of a man attacked by images is related in 47 short chapters which themselves act as engravings; a tale told by an antiquarian, full of fragmented vision and sexual hell. First published in French in 2000, <i>A Terrace in Rome</i> received the Grand Prix du Roman de l&#x2019;Acad�mie Fran�aise that same year, and went on to be translated into 19 languages. This is its first appearance in English. <br><b>Pascal Quignard</b> (born 1948) has written over 60 books of fiction, essays, and his own particular genre of philosophical reflection that straddles the personal journal, historical narrative and poetic theory. His books in English include <i>Albucius</i>, <i>All the World&#x2019;s Mornings</i>, <i>The Sexual Night</i>, <i>Sex and Terror</i>, <i>On Wooden Tablets: Apronenia Avitia</i>, and <i>The Salon in Wurttemberg</i>, as well as the multiple volumes of his ongoing book project <i>The Last Kingdom</i>, which, to date, includes <i>The Roving Shadows</i>, <i>The Silent Crossing</i> and <i>Abysses</i>.</p><p>Pascal Quignardis the author of more than sixty books and is widely regarded as one of the most important living writers in French.To say that Pascal Quignard's words are a meditation or an exploration is too simplistic - there is a philosophical stream of consciousness in his writing that has a realism both enlightened and carnal which attempts to grasp the essence of human nature in a handful of grand themes.

The book is intended to be used in a one-semester course covering modern physics for students who have already had basic physics and calculus courses. The balance of the book leans more toward ideas than toward experimental methods and practical applications because the beginning student is better served by a conceptual framework than by a mass of details. The sequence of topics follows a logical, rather than strictly historical, order. Relativity and quantum ideas are considered first to provide a framework for understanding the physics of atoms and nuclei. The theory of the atom is then developed, and followed by a discussion of the properties of aggregates of atoms, which includes a look at statistical mechanics. Finally atomic nuclei and elementary particles are examined.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Reverse Symbolism Dictionary: Symbols Listed by Subject</h2><p>Provides an alphabetical list of concepts along with the symbols used to represent them.</p><p>Award-winning author Steven Olderr is a professional librarian living in Oak Park, Illinois.Looking for symbols representing conflict?

Poor, ill-dressed, awkward, and sullen, he was the victim of vicious bullying at Harrow and Winchester. But he had inherited his mother&#39;s determination, and managed later to carve out a successful career in the General Post Office while devoting every spare moment to writing. In this book, Trollope looks back on his life with some satisfaction.Anthony Trollope (1815-82) became one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of Trollope's best-loved works revolve around the imaginary county of Barsetshire, but he also wrote penetrating novels on political, social, and gender issues and<br>conflicts of his day.</p><h2>Churchill: Visionary. Statesman. Historian.</h2><p>John Lukacs has spent a lifetime considering the complex personality and statesmanship of Winston Churchill. In previous books Lukacs has told the story of Churchill's titanic struggle with Adolf Hitler in the early days of World War II. Now, in Churchill: Visionary. Statesman. Historian., he turns his attention to Churchill the man and visionary statesman. Each chapter of this book provides an essential portrait of Churchill. Lukacs treats Churchill's vital relationships with Stalin, Roosevelt, and Eisenhower, as well as his complex, farsighted political vision concerning the coming of World War II and the Cold War. Lukacs also assesses Churchill's abilities as a historian looking backward into the origins of the conflicts of which he was so much a part. In addition, the author examines the often contradictory ways Churchill has been perceived by critics and admirers alike. <p>The last chapter is a powerful and deeply moving evocation of the three days Lukacs spent in London attending Churchill's funeral in 1965. In Churchill: Visionary. Statesman. Historian., Lukacs deftly sets forth the essence of this towering figure of twentieth-century history with the consummate mastery of a great historian.</p></p><p>Also available by John Lukacs: Five Days in London, May 1940; The Duel; At the End of an Age; The Last European War; A Thread of YearsA clear-eyed view of Winston Churchill, the workings of his historical imagination, and his successes and failures as a statesman, by the celebrated historian of World War II and best-selling author of Five Days in London, May 1940. <p>"We are in the presence of one of the most powerful, as well as one of the most learned, minds [of the] century."-Conor Cruise O'Brien</p></p><h2>The Golden Cage: The Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa, With a New Foreword by Catherine Steiner-Adair, Ed.D.</h2><p>First published more than twenty years ago, with almost 150,000 copies sold, <i>The Golden Cage</i> is still the classic book on anorexia nervosa, for patients, parents, mental health trainees, and senior therapists alike.

Short, sardonic, and dark, these six brief fiction stories and one non-fiction piece are consummate Vonnegut with piercing satire and an eye for life&#x2019;s obscene inanity. Also available for the first time is an unfinished science-fiction short story, included in the appendix. <p></p><p>These stories trace trivial human lives and mundane desires, which is precisely where Vonnegut&#x2019;s inimitable perspective as a humanist shines, illuminating his alternating hopeful and dismal outlook, although undoubtedly focusing on the latter.

Vonnegut began his career as a science fiction writer, and his early novels &#x2013; <i>Player Piano</i> and <i>The Sirens of Titan</i> &#x2013; were categorized as such even as they appealed to an audience far beyond the reach of the category. In the 1960s, Vonnegut became closely associated with the Baby Boomer generation, a writer on that side, so to speak. Scholars believe that Vonnegut&#x2019;s reputation (like Mark Twain&#x2019;s) will grow steadily through the decades as his work continues to increase in relevance and new connections are formed, new insights made.</p><h2>Workbook for Green&#x2019;s Understanding Health Insurance: A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement</h2><p>The student workbook is design to help the user retain key chapter content.

The former opened in the West End in 1926, starring Noel Coward followed by John Gielgud, to great acclaim. Three different film versions of The Constant Nymph, featuring stars of the time such as Ivor Novello and Joan Fontaine, were equally popular, and led to Kennedy&#39;s engagement in film work for a number of years from the late 1930s. She also published a study of Jane Austen (1950) and a work of literary criticism, The Outlaws on Parnassus, in 1958.

With <strong>Connect</strong> and <strong>LearnSmart,</strong> Avanti's learning platform gives instructors maximum flexibility to structure the learning experience inside and outside the classroom. <em>Avanti! </em>is known for its focus on the most critical language for communication, its active presentation of vocabulary and grammar, systematic review and recycling, and inclusion of real-world culture. With <em>Avanti!,</em> students not only learn Italian- they develop a deep appreciation for Italian culture.</p><p> The <em>Avanti! </em>program is built around the following principles:</p><p> <strong>Focused Approach / Flexible Content: </strong> <em>Avanti!</em> responds to instructors&#x2019; concerns that most programs attempt to cover too much material in the first year. Informed by second-language acquisition research, this introductory course reflects a reasonable expectation for the amount of material that most beginning learners can acquire in one year of classroom instruction. The <strong>Strutture </strong>sections include the core structures that are necessary for meaningful communication at the elementary level. Additional structures are either presented &#x201c;for recognition only&#x201d; or appear in <strong>Per saperne di piu</strong> with associatedinductive presentations and activities in <strong>Connect</strong>, giving instructors maximum flexibility to teach the grammar they want to teach. The <strong>Connect </strong>platform includes an assignment builder feature that allows instructors to fully customize the course content to meet the needs of their particular students. Instructors may choose to assign all or some of the textbook and workbook activities as well as some or all of the grammar points presented in <strong>Per saperne di pi�, </strong>based on their course goals and the course delivery method: face-to-face, hybrid, or online.

The <strong>Lessico</strong> sections have been revised to include the most up-to-date high-frequency vocabulary in use today. The <strong>Strutture</strong> sections guide students from working with Italian at the word- and sentence-level until they arrive at the final section of each chapter, <strong>Cultura</strong>, where they engage in listening, reading, writing, and speaking activities at the discourse level. Outside of class, <strong>Connect </strong>provides voice tools such as Blackboard Instant Messaging for partnered speaking practice and the Voice Board for posting voice recordings to an asynchronous voicemail thread. With <em>Avanti<strong>!</strong></em><strong> </strong> students are always well supported in their practice inside and outside of the classroom, building their communicative competence and their confidence.</p><p> <strong> </strong></p><p> <strong>Cultural Competence: </strong> <em>Avanti!</em> provides a meaningful and extensive exploration of Italy&#x2019;s rich and unique culture. In addition to the <strong>Strategie di comunicazione </strong>videos and the<strong> Grammatica dal vivo</strong> videos that feature contemporary language as it is spoken today, the<strong> Il blog di... </strong>videos showcase four different regions of Italy.

Since the first edition, Bryan A. Garner has drawn on his unrivaled experience as a legal editor to refine his positions on legal usage and to add a wealth of new material. Here's how Garner's revision makes <em>DMLU</em>, Second Edition indispensable:<br> -- Updates every existing entry, making this a second edition in the fullest sense;<br> -- Adds hundreds of new entries;<br> -- Adds hundreds of new sections within existing entries;<br> -- Adds over 3,000 new illustrative quotations from judicial opinions and leading lawbooks by prominent legal commentators;<br> -- Reconsiders previously held positions, now saying, for example, that contractions are sometimes permissible in legal writing;<br> -- Fully elaborates ideas only mentioned in the first edition;<br> -- Takes into account numerous comments received from first edition users;<br> -- Expands and updates cross-references to guide readers quickly and easily.<br> Influential writers and editors rely on <em>DMLU</em> daily. Charles Alan Wright, for example, says, "I consult Garner regularly. He offers authoritative guidance on many matters of usage that are unique to legal writing....Garner is almost always pithy; he is often witty. Any lawyer, no matter how expert on words and language, is sure to learn from Garner's fine book." And the editors of <em>Harvard Law Review</em> have found it essential: "In a work worthy of comparison to Fowler's <em>Dictionary of Modern English Usage</em>, Mr. Garner...sets forth an authoritative guide to American legal usage and style. All legal writers will find it an invaluable help; many law review editors will find it a source of delight. Don't confront your editor without it."<br> Features:<br> -- Functions both as a style guide and as a law dictionary<br> -- Guides writers to distinguish between true terms of law and mere jargon<br> -- Illustrates recommended forms of expression as well as common blunders with thousands of quotations and citations<br> -- Explains the origins of expressions lawyers regularly use, such as <em>Know all men by these presents</em>, or <em>party of the first part</em><br> -- Records and evaluates more than 100 twentieth-century neologisms, from <em>conclusory</em> to <em>farminor</em>, from <em>Mirandize</em> to <em>representee</em><br> -- Distinguishes American from British usage and refers to current practice among Australian, Canadian, and Scottish legal writers<br> -- Solves editorial problems by dealing with practical writing issues<br> -- Offers wit and erudition reminiscent of H.W. Fowler, author of the first so-called usage dictionary.<br> In short, in its Second Edition <em>DMLU</em> remains, as one reviewer hailed it in 1987, "truly unique in the literature of law." It is an essential resource for practicing lawyers, scholars of the law, and libraries of all sizes and types.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Bryan A.

Then, in a series of separate chapters, Burke explores the geography, anthropology, politics and economics of knowledge, focusing on the role of cities, academies, states and markets in the process of gathering, classifying, spreading and sometimes concealing information. The final chapters deal with knowledge from the point of view of the individual reader, listener, viewer or consumer, including the problem of the reliability of knowledge discussed so vigorously in the seventeenth century.<br> </p> <p>One of the most original features of this book is its discussion of knowledges in the plural. It centres on printed knowledge, especially academic knowledge, but it treats the history of the knowledge 'explosion' which followed the invention of printing and the discovery of the world beyond Europe as a process of exchange or negotiation between different knowledges, such as male and female, theoretical and practical, high-status and low-status, and European and non-European.<br> </p> <p>Although written primarily as a contribution to social or socio-cultural history, this book will also be of interest to historians of science, sociologists, anthropologists, geographers and others in another age of information explosion.</p></p><p><b>Asa Briggs</b> is Chancellor of the Open University and Provost of Worcester College, Oxford.<br> <p><b>Peter Burke</b> is Professor of Cultural History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</p>'In Peter Burke's scholarly hands the notion of a social history of knowledge sheds its philosophical provocation and becomes judicious, prudent and historically rich. A beautifully written and accessible exercise in historical synthesis.' <i>Steven Shapin, author of "A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England" (1994) and Professor of Sociology, University of California, San Diego</i><br> <p>'Peter Burke is an exceptional historian: a polyglot, at home in a dozen languages; an intellectual, who is well versed in theoretical developments adjacent to history; a superb expositor, with the capacity to distil his findings in unpretentious and limpidly accessible prose; and an author of unflagging vitality, whose prolific studies in the cultural history of early modern Europe and in modern historiography constitute a formidable <i>oeuvre</i> ... He has succeeded in producing a balanced, judicious and highly stimulating work of synthesis. His book will be an indispensable starting point for years to come.' <i>Keith Thomas, History Today</i><br> </p> <p>'Burke has made a significant contribution to cultural history ... [He] shows how knowledge was a form of exchange and how it became what we would recognize it as today. Burke's achievement in A Social History of Knowledge is to remind us that people in the past did not view knowledge in the same way as we do today.' <i>History</i></p></p><h2>Antigone (Methuen Drama, Methuen Student Edition)</h2><p><p><i>'Anouilh is a poet, but not of words: he is a poet of words-acted, of scenes-set, of players-performing' Peter Brook</i></p><br><p>Jean Anouilh, one of the foremost French playwrights of the twentieth century, replaced the mundane realist works of the previous era with his innovative dramas, which exploit fantasy, tragic passion, scenic poetry and cosmic leaps in time and space. <i>Antigone</i>, his best-known play, was performed in 1944 in Nazi-controlled Paris and provoked fierce controversy. In defying the tyrant Creon and going to her death, Antigone conveyed to Anouilh's compatriots a covert message of heroic resistance; but the author's characterisaation of Creon also seemed to exonerate Marshal Petain and his fellow collaborators. More ambivalent than his ancient model, Sophocles, Anouilh uses Greek myth to explore the disturbing moral dilemmas of our times. </p><br><p>Commentary and notes by Ted Freeman.</p></p><p>The body of Polynices, Antigone's brother, has been ordered to remain unburied by Creon, the new king of Thebes. Antigone's faithfulness to her dead brother and his proper burial, and her defiance of the dictator Creon, seals her fate. Originally produced in Paris during the Nazi occupation, Anouilh's Antigone was seen by the French as theatre of the resistance and by the Germans as an affirmation of authority. <p> Includes an interview with translator Christopher Nixon and director Brendon Fox. </p><p> Also includes an interview with Ned Chaillet, a playwright, radio producer and director for the BBC. Chaillet is the former Deputy Drama Critic for the Times of London and the London theatre critic for the Wall Street Journal-Europe. He spoke with us about Antigone in the context of World War Two, the differences bewtween the original myth of Sophocles and the Anouilh version, and Anouilh's influence on later playwrights. </p><p> An L.A. Theatre Works full-cast performance featuring: </p><p> Jordan Bridges as Haemon and Guard</p><p> Dominic Fumusa as Guard</p><p> Francis Guinan as Creon</p><p> John Hansen as Guard and Messenger</p><p> Alan Mandell as Chorus</p><p> Elizabeth Marvel as Antigone</p><p> Alley Mills as Nanny</p><p> Mandy Siegfried as Ismene </p><p> Directed by Brendon Fox. Recorded before a live audience at the Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles.</p><b>Jean Anouilh</b> (1910-87) is regarded as one of France's best-known dramatists. ANTIGONE firmly established his popularity in France in 1944 and Peter Brook's 1950 production of Ring Round the Moon (1947) made his name in England. Twice married, he lived mainly in Switzerland for the last thirty years of his life.</p><h2>How to Read the Bible for It&#39;s Worth</h2><p>Your Guide to Understanding the Bible Understanding the Bible isn&#x2019;t for the few, the gifted, the scholarly.

This book directs sustained attention to Finlay the verbal artist, revealing the full breadth and richness of his poetics. It illuminates the evolution from his early years of composing plays, stories, and lyrical poems to his discovery of Concrete poetry and his emergence as a key figure in the international avant-garde of the 1960s.</p><p>&#x201c;The Scottish concrete poet, visual artist, short story writer, aphorist, editor, and &#x2018;avant-gardener&#x2019; Ian Hamilton Finlay is one of the great polymaths of our time. His writings alone would put him in the pantheon of twentieth century poets. Finlay&#x2019;s son Alec, himself a poet, has now given us a selection of his father&#x2019;s writings, beautifully edited and annotated, lavishly illustrated, and with a superb new introduction to the work. I consider this book, long overdue, to be a milestone in publishing. &#x2015;Marjorie Perloff, author of <i>The Futurist Moment and Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by other means in the 21st Century</i><br><br>"Ian Hamilton Finlay was an entirely original, and continuously challenging, voice in the poetry of the English-speaking world over the second half of the twentieth century. This promises to be the first book in which his early verse, his concrete poetry and his distinctive compilations of aphorisms and &#x2018;sentences&#x2019; are all substantially represented." &#x2015;Stephen Bann, author of <i>Ways Around Modernism</i><br><br>&#x201c;When I was young and trying to figure out how to think about landscapes and gardens and their cultural histories, no one opened the garden gates wider than Ian Hamilton Finlay in his poetic and sometimes provocative print projects, garden sculptures, concrete poems (sometimes in actual concrete or stone), aphorisms, and other works. Finlay was a loner, a visionary looking backward to think on revolution and paradise, Arcadia and insurrection, and this book put together by his artist son Alec makes that work available for the first time in a long while, and as gorgeously as possible. Alec's long biographical essay is itself a hugely valuable resource for anyone interested in the elder Finlay's works, and then there are the poems, and the pictures...&#x201d; &#x2015;Rebecca Solnit, author of <i>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</i><br><br>&#x201c;Only a handful of poets working in the visual tradition in the twentieth century have a profile that shows up in the broader scenes of fine art and modern culture. Among them, Ian Hamilton Finlay is probably the most frequently cited. But the work and thinking of this complex, enigmatic, and sometimes controversial figure is not necessarily well understood. This new volume documenting the many facets of Finlay's work as a poet, sculptor, and thinker across many media and a lifetime of creative activity will make it possible to study and appreciate his work anew. This collection makes a welcome addition to studies in book arts, visual poetry, and conceptual art through the presentation of an artist whose contributions have registered across these fields.&#x201d; &#x2015;Johanna Drucker, Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles<br><br>&#x201c;While Ian Hamilton Finlay&#x2019;s career is one of complexity, as a creator he was a champion of the simple. Engaging regional melodies, quotidian objects, and native terrain, he took poetry back to its Greek root, &#x2018;to make.&#x2019; This half-century journey&#x2015;from folk poem to concrete poem to poem-in-the-world&#x2015;is at all points filled with a vital restlessness.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lisa Jarnot, author of <i>Night Scenes</i><br><br>&#x201c;One must never forget that poets are <i>makers,</i> most vividly so in Scotland, where William Dunbar&#x2019;s &#x2018;Lament for the Makaris&#x2019; must still echo with uncanny poignance. Poetry is &#x2018;a made thing&#x2019;, as Robert Duncan put it. No poet will ever manage a word, much less a line, without all the resources of that art in timeless history sounding there, as each word finds its place in turn. There is no way to learn simply the intimacy of voice that Finlay has always, bringing one in to his physical person. It is a constant of his art in all its forms.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robert Creeley, from the foreword to the 1996 edition of Ian Hamilton Finlay&#x2019;s <i>The Dancers Inherit the Party and Glasgow Beasts, an a Burd</i><br><b>Ian Hamilton Finlay</b> (1925-2006) was an acclaimed Scottish poet and artist. <b>Alec Finlay</b> is an artist and poet.</p><h2>The Lincoln Assassination Conspirators: Their Confinement and Execution, as Recorded in the Letterbook of John Frederick Hartranft</h2><p><p>On May 1, 1865, two weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, recently inaugurated president Andrew Johnson appointed John Frederick Hartranft to command the military prison at the Washington Arsenal, where the U.S. government had just incarcerated the seven men and one woman accused of complicity in the shooting. From that day through the execution of four of the accomplices, the Pennsylvania-born general held responsibility for the most notorious prisoners in American history. A strict adherent to protocol, Hartranft kept a meticulously detailed account of his experiences in the form of a letterbook. In The Lincoln Assassination Conspirators, noted Lincoln scholars Edward Steers, Jr., and Harold Holzer, in partnership with the National Archives, present this fascinating historical record for the first time with contextual materials and expert annotations, providing a remarkable glimpse behind the scenes of the assassination's aftermath.<br>Hartranft oversaw every aspect of the prisoners' daily lives, from making sure they were fed and kept clean to ensuring that no one communicated with them except on the written orders of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. In his Letterbook, Hartranft scrupulously recounts the arrival of each prisoner and describes the prison routine -- which included three simple meals a day, a twice-daily cell inspection by Hartranft himself, and frequent physical examinations by an army physician. The prisoners wore wrist and leg shackles and, controversially, most of them wore special hoods designed to isolate them from their surroundings.<br>When the conspirators' trial began, the nation waited eagerly for news, and many sought retribution against those they held responsible for the nation's grief. Hartranft resisted calls for both vengeance and mercy and continued to treat his notorious charges as humanely as possible, facilitating meetings with clergy and sending letters to and from family members. Yet, as his detached, detailed description of the execution of four of the conspirators shows, he did not allow emotion to impede the performance of his duty. <br>The legal and moral issues surrounding the conspirators' trial -- the extraordinary use of military rather than civil justice, the treatment of the accused while incarcerated, the fine line between swift and precipitous justice -- remain volatile, unsettled issues today. Hartranft's keen observations, ably analyzed by historians Steers and Holzer, will add a riveting new chapter to the story of Lincoln's assassination.</p></p><p><p>Edward Steers, Jr., is the author or editor of numerous books and articles on the life and death of Abraham Lincoln, including The Escape and Capture of John Wilkes Booth and Lincoln Legends: Myths, Hoaxes, and Confabulations Associated with Our Greatest President.

These predictions are contained in The Kolbrin Bible, a secular wisdom text studied in the days of Jesus and lovingly preserved by generations of Celtic mystics in Great Britain. Nearly as big as the King James Bible, this 3600-year old text warns of an imminent, Armageddon-like conflict with radical Islam, but this is not the greatest threat. The authors of The Kolbrin Bible predict an end to life as we know it, by a celestial event. It will be the return of a massive space object, in a long elliptical orbit around our sun. Known to the Egyptians and Hebrews as the &#34;Destroyer,&#34; the Celts later called it the &#34;Frightener.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Expositor&#39;s Bible Commentary Abridged Edition: Old Testament (Expositor&#39;s Bible Commentary)</h2><p><p><strong>All the verse-by-verse insights of the 6-volume Expositor's Bible Commentary Old Testament set--in one convenient volume.</strong></p><p>When you want to dig more deeply into the meaning of God's Word, a good expository Bible commentary is ideal.

Hejduk, an intellectual descendant of the heroic period of modern architecture, has consistently used and maneuvered the modernist vocabulary, forcing it, in the design process, to reflect his personal poetic vision. Sections, plans, and axonometrics are complemented with rough or thumbnail sketches showing their germination. These beautiful drawings take on a narrative strength when grouped together and serve to illuminate Hejduk's architectonic thoughts.

In this study, John McGreevy chronicles the world of Catholic parishes - and connects their place in urban history to the course of American race relations in the 20th century. In portraits of parish life in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and other cities, McGreevy examines the contacts and conflicts between Euro-American Catholics and their African-American neighbours. He demonstrates how the territorial nature of the parish - more bound by geography than Protestant or Jewish congregations - kept Catholics in their neighbourhoods, and how this commitment to place complicated efforts to integrate urban neighbourhoods. He also shows how the church responded to the growing number of African-American parishioners by condemning racism, and how this teaching was received in communities rocked by racial strife. Taking the story through the Second Vatican Council and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, McGreevy demonstrates how debates about community and racial justice reshaped the character of American Catholicism. Tracing the transformation of a church, its people, and the nation over the course of nearly a century, this work illuminates the impact of religious culture on the course of modern American history.</p><p>Steeples topped by crosses still dominate neighborhood skylines in many American cities, silent markers of local worlds rarely examined by historians.

From gravity to the theory of relativity, this unique book provides visual interpretations of complex concepts, designed to make learning physics easier and a whole lot more fun!</p></p><p><p><b>Dan Green</b> studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge University. Since graduating, he has written and edited many popular science titles and humorous books, become the editor of a South American national newspaper, worked as a travel writer, as well as developing and editing the wildly successful Horrible Science magazine collection. He is the "voice" of Basher's bestselling science-made-easy books, and to date has written nine titles in the series.</p><p><b>Simon Basher</b> is a well-known illustrator who enjoys playing in the world of contemporary character design. Inspired by a love of simple line work and a rich color palette, his characters fill the gap between edgy manga and the cuteness of Hello Kitty.</p>Grade 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;This follow-up to Adrian Dingle's <i>The Periodic Table</i> (Kingfisher, 2007) introduces the elements of physics as anthropomorphic, cartoon-style characters. "You could say that these forceful fellows are the ones that really matter." They are grouped by associations: "Old School" (mass, weight, density, etc.), "Hot Stuff" (energy, entropy, etc.), "Wave Gang" (sound, frequency, etc.), "Light Crew" (radio wave, microwave, etc.), "Atom Family" (proton, electron, etc.), "Nuclear Heavies" (radioactivity, alpha particle, etc.), and "Electric Cuties" (static electricity, electric current, etc.). Each of the groupings begins with an introduction and each concept is given its own spread that shows the cartoon figure and describes its "personality." The information is presented in a chatty and conversational tone. For example, Blackbody Radiation is described as "a ninjalike shadow who swallows and slays the Light Crew." Along with the narrative, which is written in the first person from the concept's point of view, other key facts are presented. This book would be handy as a supplement to a physics curriculum.&#x2014;<i>Maren Ostergard, King County Library System, Issaquah, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Readers of this colorful volume will see the heroics and the brutally rugged individualism that made these fur trappers candidates for legend and infamy.<br><br>The accounts of the mountain men are spun from the experiences of a nation moving westward: a trapper returns from the dead; hunters feast on buffalo intestines served on a dirty blanket; a missionary woman is astounded by the violence and vulgarity of the trappers&#x2019; rendezvous. These are just a few of the narratives, tall tales, and just plain lies that make up <i>A Rendezvous Reader</i>.<br><br>The writers represented in this book include a dyed-in-the wool trappers, adventuring European nobles, upward-gazing eastern missionaries, and just plain hacks who never unsheathed a Green River knife or traveled farther west that the Ohio River. What these writers have in common is that all of them, whether they dealt mostly in fact of entirely in fantasy, helped to create a uniquely American icon: the mountain man.<br><br>Though <i>A Rendezvous Reader</i> will certainly be of interest to the historian and the historically curious, the true purpose of this anthology is to bring together in one volume the liveliest most readable accounts by and about the mountain men. Whether you sample or devour this anthology of mountain horrors and delights, it is a book guaranteed to entertain as well as inform.</p></p><p><p><b>James H.

Bede's The Reckoning of Time (De temporum ratione) was the first comprehensive treatise on this subject, and the model and reference for all subsequent teaching, discussion and criticism of the Christian calendar. The Reckoning of Time is a systematic exposition of the Julian solar calendar and the Paschal table of Dionysius Exiguus, with their related formulae for calculating dates. But it is more than a technical handbook. Bede sets calendar lore within a broad scientific framework and a coherent Christian concept of time, and incorporates themes as diverse as the theory of tides and the threat of chiliasm. This translation of the full text includes an extensive historical introduction and a chapter-by-chapter commentary. The Reckoning of Time also serves as an accessible introduction to the computus itself.<br></p><p><b>Faith Wallis </b>is associate professor in the department of history at McGill University.&nbsp;This is the first full translation of this work, and beautifully edited.

With over 130 service sector examples and case histories, you will discover where to start, what to measure, how to measure it, and how to understand the measurement. More than teaching how to create process behavior charts, this book takes you beyond merely understanding data to a framework in which to use it effectively. It provides the practical expertise and useful guidance that you have come to expect from Donald J. Wheeler.</p><p>Dr. Donald J.

Martin as source material for <em>Game of Thrones</em>, comes a classic book on innovation and technological change in medieval Europe</strong></p><p>In this account of Europe&#x2019;s rise to world leadership in technology, Frances and Joseph Gies show how early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. The Gieses report that many of Europe&#x2019;s most important inventions&#x2014;the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, and &#x201c;Arabic&#x201d; numerals&#x2014;had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and the Middle East. Europe synthesized its own innovations&#x2014;the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system&#x2014;into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics.<em></em></p></p><p>Historians, write Frances and Joseph Gies, have long tended to view the Middle Ages as a period of intellectual and scientific stagnation, a long era of backwardness, ignorance, and inertia. Many scholars of the Renaissance era, however, thought otherwise; the mathematician Jerome Cardan, for one, held that three medieval inventions--the magnetic compass, the printing press, and gunpowder--were of such significance that "the whole of antiquity has nothing equal to show."<p> In their lively history of medieval technology, the Gies team writes of such advances as the heavy plow, the Gothic flying buttress, linen undergarments, water pumps, and the lateen sail. During the medieval millennium, they suggest, a great technological and social revolution occurred "with the disappearance of mass slavery, the shift to water- and wind-power, the introduction of the open-field system of agriculture, and the importation, adaptation, or invention of an array of devices, from the wheelbarrow to double-entry bookkeeping." Many of those inventions or adaptations, brought into Europe from China and the Middle East, have scarcely been improved on today.</p><p> The medieval technological revolution, the authors conclude, came at a cost: much of Europe was deforested to make room for cropland and to fire kilns and furnaces, and mechanization made obsolete many handicraft skills. Yet, they add, the workers and inventors of the Middle Ages "all transformed the world, on balance very much to the world's advantage." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>An illuminating look at the monumental inventions of the Middle Ages, by the authors <em>of Life in a Medieval Castle</em>.</p><h2>Called To Reign: Living and Loving from a Place of Rest</h2><p><p>Like most Christians, you long to fulfill your calling. You seek the inheritance God has promised you. And you work hard to serve Him well and enter into His rest.But what if your destiny is already within reach? What if you already have access to all the things He has promised? What if, instead of working for rest, you can actually work from rest?</p> <p>The world, including most of the church, is working hard in order to find peace and rest. That&#x2019;s why we see a constant cycle of restlessness around us. But we were designed to work from a place of rest, fully secure in our identity as children of God. This resting place is found in intimacy with the Father, where His family members experience complete acceptance and extravagant love.</p> <p><em>The resting place is there, available from God anywhere, anytime</em></p> <p>We are sons and daughters of a loving Father, not orphans trying to figure out who we are. We are called to reveal the true nature of God, and we cannot do that with an orphan mindset. When sons and daughters arise in the church, the world will begin to see the true nature of the Father and His family&#x2015;a family that sees promises, not problems, and that reigns with Him!</p> <p>Using his well-known illustration of the three chairs, Leif Hetland explores the four pillars of this resting place, addressing four crucial questions:</p> <ul> <li>Identity: Who are you?</li> <li>Intimacy: Where are you?</li> <li>Inheritance: What do you have?</li> <li>Destiny: What are you called to do?</li> </ul> <p>The key to fulfilling your destiny is realizing the answers to each of these questions&#x2015;in the order God designed for us.</p> <p>This book is will help you experience everything God wants for you by finding a resting place for yourself and becoming a resting place for Him. It is about an entirely different way to see and live, a way that refreshes, restores, and brings life. It is an invitation into the fullness and abundance that empowers you to do what you were called to do&#x2015;to reign with Him!</p></p><p><p>Leif Hetland is founder and president of Global Mission Awareness.

Happily, Peter has taken up his facile pen again to describe these changes, a virtual revolution in the practice of investing that relies heavily on complex mathematics, derivatives, hedging, and hyperactive trading. This fine and eminently readable book is unlikely to be surpassed as the definitive chronicle of a truly historic era."<br> &#x2014;<b>John C. Bogle</b>, founder of The Vanguard Group and author, <i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i><br> <br> "Just as Dante could not have understood or survived the perils of the Inferno without Virgil to guide him, investors today need Peter Bernstein to help find their way across dark and shifting ground. No one alive understands Wall Street's intellectual history better, and that makes Bernstein our best and wisest guide to the future. He is the only person who could have written this book; thank goodness he did."<br> &#x2014;<b>Jason Zweig</b>, Investing Columnist, <i>Mone</i>y magazine<br> <br> "Another must-read from Peter Bernstein! This well-written and thought-provoking book provides valuable insights on how key finance theories have evolved from their ivory tower formulation to profitable application by portfolio managers.

El-Erian</b>, President and CEO of Harvard Management Company, Deputy Treasurer of Harvard University, and member of the faculty of the Harvard Business School<br> <br> "Reading <i>Capital Ideas Evolving</i> is an experience not to be missed.

Strumpf</b>, Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, The Ford Foundation<br> <br> "With great clarity, Peter Bernstein introduces us to the insights of investment giants, and explains how they transformed financial theory into portfolio practice.

Peter Bernstein once again has produced a masterpiece that is must reading for practitioners, educators and students of finance."<br> &#x2014;<b>Andr� F. Perold</b>, Professor of Finance, Harvard Business School</p><p><p>In all of history and in all fields of intellectual endeavor, a tension has existed between theory and practice. Those of us who earn a living in the real world seldom want to appear as slaves to some set of abstract ideas. It was no surprise, therefore, that the word "baloney" was Wall Street's greeting to the pioneering theories of finance developed by a small group of academics in their ivory towers during the years from 1954 to 1972. Yet those breakthrough theories would in time earn five Nobel Prizes in Economic Science. Baloney they were not.</p> <p>In Capital Ideas Evolving, today's foremost financial historian expands upon his groundbreaking book of 1992, Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street, to recount how these financial theories finally migrated from the towers of ivory to the towers of glass on Wall Street and other financial centers around the world. The result has been a global revolution in the nature of financial markets, the menu of investment strategies, the development of exotic financial instruments, and the role of an uncertain future in all investment decisions. Even the academics who originally developed these theories are active today in the markets and in the creation of new financial structures and strategies.</p> <p>The opening pages of Capital Ideas Evolving confront the attack on these theories from researchers in Behavioral Finance, who argue that the theoretical assumptions of fully rational investors are a far cryfrom reality. Bernstein finds strong positive conse-quences in the daily interaction between these critics and the impact of financial theory. Based on personal interviews with leading practitioners and theorists&#x2014;including five of those who played a prominent role in Capital Ideas&#x2014;this book also describes how today's key practical applications developed from the core ideas of finance theory into the new and exciting formats of the investment process found in today's environment. This story includes the startling success of a group of leading institutional investors, all of whom developed their strategies from a base composed of the principles once categorized as "baloney."</p> <p>As Bernstein traverses between financial theory and a history of modern financial innovation, he gives us a vivid and enlightening view of today's investment world. This engaging and insightful book brings to life the individuals, ideas, and issues that are transforming the financial landscape.</p><b>Peter L. Bernstein</b> is President of Peter L.

It was intended, wrote Carroll,<i> "to be read by Children aged from Nought to Five. To be read? Nay, not so! Say rather to be thumbed, to be cooed over, to be dogs'-eared, to be rumpled, to be kissed . . ."</i> With this new, younger readership in mind, Carroll rewrote <i>Alice,</i> simplifying and abridging the original text, while Tenniel redrew, enlarged, and colored 20 of his iconic illustrations. The resulting book is a delightfully engaging experience, readers prompted to interact not only with the story but also with the images and even the physical book itself, in a way that is thoroughly modern. Gloriously reproduced for the anniversary year, the present edition retains every word of the original and restores the exquisite delicacy of Tenniel's artwork&#x2014;lost in reproductions across the decades&#x2014;along with the delightful cover artwork by Emily Gertrude Thomson, a placeholder ribbon, and gold page edges.

Its inspiration came from pioneering British architect and designer Owen Jones (1809&#x2013;1874), who produced a comprehensive design treatise for the machine age, lavishly illustrated in vivid chromolithographic color. Jones made detailed observations of decorative arts on his travels in Europe, the Middle East, and in his native London, where he studied objects on display at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in 1851 and at local museums. His aim was to improve the quality of Western design by changing the habits of Victorian designers, who indiscriminately mixed elements from a wide variety of sources.</p><p>Jones's resulting study is a comprehensive analysis of styles of ornamental design, presenting key examples ranging from Maori tattoos, Egyptian columns, and Greek borders to Byzantine mosaic, Indian embroidery, and Elizabethan carvings.

WILL</i> is a columnist for the Washington Post Writer�s Group and a contributing editor of<i> Newsweek</i>. He appears weekly on the ABC-TV program <i>This Week</i>. A winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, he lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.</p>Pundits pontificate: it's their job. But few seem to take as much pleasure in pontificating as syndicated columnist Will, a regular on ABC's Sunday-morning <i>This Week</i>. (Who but Will would title columns "What the Remorseless Improvers Have Wrought" or "Hillary Clinton's Insouciant Insincerity"?) Will is also a master at cross-platform synergy: this is his <i>seventh</i> collection, composed primarily of columns but also including commencement addresses and other pieces. (Each essay is dated, but previous publication data are omitted.) Several sections of the collection are relatively focused: "The World" addresses foreign policy; "Justice and Injustice," court decisions and legislation; "Reasonable Doubts," culture and lifestyle; "Contingencies Large and Small," politics; and "Regulating Campaigning," the campaign finance reform movement Will despises. Broader in scope are Will's opening "Overture," whose 28 essays range in subject from patriotism and the marines to the Unabomber, Rodney King, Tiger Woods, and Santa Claus; the section's last five pieces are year-end assessments of 1997 through 2001. Will closes with a "People" section whose subjects include Princess Diana, Hitler, C. S. Lewis, Joe DiMaggio, the late <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Meg Greenfield, Will's father, and Will himself at age 60. A wallow for Will fans but unlikely to convert the uncommitted. <i>Mary Carroll</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is a work that resonates with Vonnegut&#x2019;s singular voice: the magic sound of a born storyteller mesmerizing us with truth.<br><br> <b>&#x201c;Vonnegut is at the top of his form, and it is wonderful.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Newsday</i></b></p><p><b>Kurt Vonnegut</b>&#x2019;s black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America&#x2019;s attention in<i> The Sirens of Titan</i><b> </b>in 1959 and established him as &#x201c;a true artist&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>) with <i>Cat&#x2019;s Cradle<b><i> </i></b></i>in 1963. He was, as Graham Greene declared, &#x201c;one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br><i>The First Amendment<br></i><br>I am a member of what I believe to be the last recognizable generation of full-time, life-time American novelists. We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young&#x2013;while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.<br><br>No more.<br><br>Nor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as member of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.<br><br>It was an amusing and instructive time for writers&#x2013;for hundreds of them.<br><br>Television wrecked the short-story branch of the industry, and now accountants and business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone's first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.<br><br>So, as I say, I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.<br><br>The most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central&#x2013;perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.<br><br>� � �<br><br>James Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway's, Charles Scribner's Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together&#x2013;so that they could enjoy each other's company as old warriors.<br><br>Jones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as he pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.<br><br>� � �<br><br>It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br><br>How could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn't&#x2013;it can't. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.<br><br>And even now my books, along with books by Bernard Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.<br><br>� � �<br><br>My novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in th entire novel is this: "Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker." This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain's assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain's assistant had attracted enemy fire.<br><br>So on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:<br><br>Dear Mr. McCarthy:<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.<br><br>Certain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.<br><br>I want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?<br><br>I gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.<br><br>If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don't damage children much. They didn't damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.<br><br>After I have said all this. I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, "Yes, yes&#x2013;but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community." This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.<br><br>I read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can't stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.<br><br>If you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books&#x2013;books you hadn't even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.<br><br>Again: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>That was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.<br><br>At the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of <i>The New York Times</i>. It went like this:<br><br>A school board has denounced some books again&#x2013;out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.<br><br>It was so cowardly, too&#x2013;to make a great show of attacking artifacts. It was like St. George attacking bedspreads and cuckoo clocks.<br><br>Yes, and St. Georges like that seem to get elected or appointed to school committees all the time. They are actually proud of their illiteracry. They imagine that they are somehow celebrating the bicentennial when they boast, as some did in Levittown, that they hadn't actually read the books they banned.<br><br>Such lunks are often the backbone of volunteer fire departments and the United States Infantry and cake sales and so on, and they have been thanked often enough for that. But they have no business supervising the eductions of children in a free society. They are just too bloody stupid.<br><br>Here is how I propose to end book-banning in this country once and for all: Every candidate for school committee should be hooked up to a lie-detector and asked this question: "Have you read a book from start to finish since high school? Or did you even read a book from start to finish in high school?"<br><br>If the truthful answer is "no," then the candidate should be told politely that he cannot get on the school committee and blow off his big bazoo about how books make children crazy.<br><br>Whenever ideas are squashed in this country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must be allowed to live. It is time for them to realize that they are attempting to explain America at its bravest and most optimistic to orangutans.<br><br>From now on, I intend to limit my discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas to this advice: "Have somebody read the First Amendment to the United States Constitution out loud to you, you God damned fool!"<br><br>Well&#x2013;the American Civil Liberties Union or somebody like that will come to the scene of trouble, as they always do. They will explain what is in the Constitution, and to whom it applies.<br><br>They will win.<br><br>And there will be millions who are bewildered and heartbroken by the legal victory, who think some things should never be said&#x2013;especially about religion.<br><br>They are in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Hi ho.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br><br>Why is it so ordinary for American citizens to show such scorn for the First Amendment? I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979. The house where I spoke, incidentally, was said to be the model for Gatsby's house in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. I saw no reason to doubt the claim.<br><br>I said this in such a setting:<br><br>"I will not speak directly to the ejection of my book <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> from the school libraries of Island Trees. I have a vested interest. I wrote the book, after all, so why wouldn&#x2019;t I argue that it is less repulsive than the school board says?<br><br>"I will speak of Thomas Aquinas instead. I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God's law. Beneath that was natural law, which I suppose would include thunderstorms, and our right to shield our children from poisonous ideas, and so on.<br><br>"And the lowest law was human law.<br><br>"Let me clarify this scheme by comparing its parts to playing cards. Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn't we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.<br><br>"The Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded. Theologians can give us hints of the wording, but it takes a dictator to set them down just right&#x2013;to dot the <i>i</i>'s and cross the <i>t</i>'s. A man who had been a mere corporal in the army did that for Germany and then for all of Europe, you may remember, not long ago. There was nothing he did not know about divine and natural law. He had fistfuls of aces and kings to play.<br><br>"Meanwhile, over on this side of the Atlantic, we were not playing with a full deck, as they say. Because of our Constitution, the highest card anybody had to play was a lousy queen, contemptible human law. That remains true today.

Each play is presented complete and unabridged, in large print. Every book is well illustrated, and starts with a commentary and character summary. Scene synopses and character summaries clarify confusing plots, while incisive essays explore the historical context and Shakespeare's sources. Each book ends with a complete list of Shakespeare's plays and a brief chronology of the Bard's life. The detailed explanatory notes are written clearly and positioned right next to the text--no more squinting at microscopic footnotes or flipping pages back and forth in search of endnotes!<br> The new edition of the series features new covers and new illustrations, including both new drawings and photos from recent productions of Shakespeare's plays around the globe. In addition, the notes and the introductory material have been completely revised in line with new research and in order to make them clearer and more accessible.

Starring Stella Gonet as Viola, with Christopher Godwin as Malvolio, Lucy Whybrow as Olivia, Jane Whittenshaw as Maria, Benjamin Soames as Sebastian and Adam Kotz as Antonio.Set in a topsy-turvy world like a holiday revel, this comedy devises a romantic plot around separated twins, misplaced passions, and mistaken identity. Juxtaposed to it is the satirical story of a self-deluded steward who dreams of becoming &#34;Count Malvolio&#34; only to receive his comeuppance at the hands of the merrymakers he wishes to suppress. The two plots combine to create a farce touched with melancholy, mixed throughout with seductively beautiful explorations on the themes of love and time, and the play ends, not with laughter, but with a clown&#39;s sad song.</p><h2>The King is Coming: Preparing to Meet Jesus</h2><p>From panic to punchline, public perception about the return of Christ reveals an alarming lack of understanding of biblical prophecy.

Unlike the French, with whom Great Lakes Indians had formed an alliance of convenience, the British entered the upper Great Lakes in a spirit of conquest. British officers on the frontier keenly felt the need to assert their assumed superiority over both Native Americans and European settlers. At the same time, Indian leaders expected appropriate tokens of British regard, gifts the British refused to give. It is this issue of respect that, according to Gregory Dowd, lies at the root of the war the Ottawa chief Pontiac and his alliance of Great Lakes Indians waged on the British Empire between 1763 and 1767.</p><p>In War under Heaven, Dowd boldly reinterprets the causes and consequences of Pontiac's War. Where previous Anglocentric histories have ascribed this dramatic uprising to disputes over trade and land, this groundbreaking work traces the conflict back to status: both the low regard in which the British held the Indians and the concern among Native American leaders about their people's standing -- and their sovereignty -- in the eyes of the British. Pontiac's War also embodied a clash of world views, and Dowd examines the central role that Indian cultural practices and beliefs played in the conflict, explores the political and military culture of the British Empire which informed the attitudes its servants had toward Indians, provides deft and insightful portraits of Pontiac and his British adversaries, and offers a detailed analysis of the military and diplomatic strategies of both sides. Imaginatively conceived and compellingly told, War under Heaven redefines our understanding of Anglo-Indian relations in the colonial period.</p></p><p><p>Gregory Evans Dowd is a professor of history and American Culture and the director of Native American Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He is the author of A Spirited Resistance: The North American Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745--1815, also available from Johns Hopkins.</p><p>"An up-to-date ethnohistorical study of the war called Pontiac's is long overdue. Gregory Dowd has provided a masterful narrative and analysis of the war, grounded in deep research and insightful readings of the primary sources. He offers an important new interpretation of the conflict, showing how the British and Indian nations understood the war as a struggle for social and political status within the empire. War under Heaven represents a major contribution to understanding eighteenth-century America." -- Colin G.

Best known for her videos and photography, Rosler has also been an original and influential cultural critic and theorist for over twenty-five years. The writings collected here address such key topics as documentary photography, feminist art, video, government patronage of the arts, censorship, and the future of digitally based photographic media. Taken together, these thirteen essays not only show Rosler's importance as a critic but also offer an essential resource for readers interested in the issues confronting contemporary art. The essays in this collection illustrate Rosler's ongoing investigation into means of exposing truth and provoking change, providing a retrospective of characteristic issues in her work.</p><p>Mixing analysis and wit, Rosler challenges many of the fundamental precepts of contemporary art practice. Her influential essay, "In, around, and afterthoughts: on documentary photography," almost single-handedly dismantled the myth of liberal documentary photography when it appeared. Many of the essays in this volume have had a similarly wide-ranging influence; others are published here for the first time. Illustrating the essays are 81 images by Rosler and other artists and photographers.</p></p><p>"Martha Rosler, one of the most important critical thinkers and artists of the present, becomes available in this collection of vitally important essays. Her work constitutes a major oeuvre in the analysis of the processes of power in our society -- processes so embedded in the practices of daily life that we no longer see or know them. Her trenchant and lucid analyses of the relations between life worlds and art worlds is ever more timely in its historical depth and contemporary relevance." --Griselda Pollock, University of Leeds <p>"For many years, and almost singlehandedly, Martha Rosler has provided a solid theoretical basis for critical studies in photography and video. This collection of her lucid essays is a useful compilation of her most important theoretical work. Seeing the essays (and a fascinating collection of photographs) together in this book, one is struck by the depth of her work: a unique blend of insight as critical clarity and art as idea." --DeeDee Halleck, independent film maker, and Professor Emeritus of Communications, University of California, San Diego </p><p>"Martha Rosler's practice demonstrates that feminism is not a politics of the few but a politics of the many, and that gender inequality is neither distinct from racial and class injustice nor separable from the politics of representation and power relations of the artistic field. *Decoys and Disruptions* constitutes a theory of activist art at its fiercest, most complex, and most urgent." --Linda Nochlin, Lila Acheson Wallace Professor of Modern Art, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University </p><p>"Rosler's writings of the past three decades have acquired an unsought monumental status: they remind us of what it means to conceive of the artist as a public intellectual, as an activist, and as a critical voice in the cultural public sphere. They thus serve as emergency instructions: how activist practice could be resuscitated now, when it is needed most -- in the darkest moment of the near disappearance of public political consciousness." --Benjamin H.

He offers his interpretation of how schizophrenia develops, typically in the teens, as an adaptation in the difficult transition to adulthood.&nbsp;<br><br> With tenderness, Bollas depicts schizophrenia as an understandable way of responding to our precariousness in a highly unpredictable world.&nbsp; He celebrates the courage of the children he has worked with and reminds us that the wisdom inherent in human beings&#x2014;to turn to conversation with others when in distress&#x2014;is the fundamental foundation of any cure for human conflict.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Christopher Bollas</b>&nbsp;is a psychoanalyst, practicing for over 40 years.

It tells us not just about the world of schizophrenia but also about what it is for all of us to be human, struggling not to be too frightened to live in a world of chance events. Its stories of the work of therapy illustrate the patient effort that is involved in respecting another person, and, indeed, offer a paradigm of love."&#x2014;Martha C. Nussbaum, The University of Chicago<br>"Imaginative, heartfelt and moving, this is a beautiful book. Bollas' compassion and respect for his patients is palpable on these pages. The result is a sense of shared humanity, understanding and even hope. There's misery in <i>When the Sun Bursts</i>, and yet you will come away feeling ignited and consoled."&#x2014;Stephen Grosz, author of <i>The Examined Life</i><br>"If you want a book that will give you the living, vibrant, painful process of truly working with schizophrenia, then read this book. Christopher Bollas is famous in the world of psychoanalysis and beyond for the way he pushes us to the limits of possible thought. Here, in the most resonant, sensitive and even poetic writing&#x2014;writing which teaches us anew what it really means to listen&#x2014;Bollas makes a crucial clinical and political intervention into the increasingly vexed question of how to approach mental disturbance in our time."&#x2014;Jacqueline Rose, author of <i>Women in Dark Times</i><br>"Christopher Bollas writes with dazzling insight into the embattled mental world of schizophrenia. A profound and moving meditation on the tribulations of human subjectivity."&#x2014;Barbara Taylor, author of <i>The Last Asylum: a Memoir of Madness in Our Times </i>(2014)<br>"In this absorbing, elegant, and uplifting new book, Christopher Bollas takes the reader on a personal odyssey through schizophrenia. In an era of biological reductionism, Bollas reminds us that no one we encounter in our work is completely out of reach by another human being. We all owe Bollas a debt of gratitude for keeping alive the flame with this extraordinary contribution."&#x2014;Glen O.

Cawelti Award for the Best Textbook / Primer&nbsp;</b><b></b> What is popular culture? Why study popular culture in an academic context? An Introduction to U.S. Popular Culture: People, Politics, and Power introduces and explores the history and contemporary analysis of popular culture in the United States. In situating popular culture as lived experience through the activities, objects, and distractions of everyday life, the authors work to broaden the understanding of culture beyond a focus solely on media texts, taking an interdisciplinary approach to analyze American culture, its rituals, beliefs, and the objects that shape its existence. <br><br>After building a foundation of the history of popular culture as an academic discipline, the book looks broadly at cultural myths and the institutional structures, genres, industries, and people that shape the mindset of popular culture in the United States. It then becomes more focused with an examination of identity, exploring the ways in which these myths and mindset are internalized, practiced, and shaped by individuals. The book concludes by connecting the broad understanding of popular culture and the unique individual experience with chapters dedicated to the objects, communities, and celebrations of everyday life. This approach to the field of study explores all matters of culture in a way that is accessible and relevant to individuals in and outside of the classroom.</p><p><b>Jenn Brandt</b>&nbsp;is an associate professor of women's studies at California State University, Dominguez Hills.

It is because all three have been classifiers, founders of language of erotic pleasure, a language of social happiness, a language of divine address- and because each of them has expended , in the construction of this secondary language, all the energy of a passion . The object of this book, for Barthes is not to hover over the propositions of content ordinary credited to these three men --ie, a philosophy of evil ,a utopian socialism, a mystique of obedience--but rather to consider Sade, Fourier , and Loyola as formulators, inventors of writing, wielders of a text: operator, as Barthes calls them.

But it was a role he took up late in life, that of writer, that won him enduring fame and critical acclaim&#x2014;as well as the devotion of readers worldwide. Though the 1976 collection<i> A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</i> was the only book Maclean published in his lifetime, it was an unexpected success, and the moving family tragedy of the title novella&#x2014;based largely on Maclean&#x2019;s memories of his childhood home in Montana&#x2014;has proved to be one of the most enduring American stories ever written. <br><br><i>The Norman Maclean Reader</i> is a wonderful addition to Maclean&#x2019;s celebrated oeuvre. Bringing together previously unpublished materials with incidental writings and selections from his more famous works, the <i>Reader</i> will serve as the perfect introduction for readers new to Maclean, while offering longtime fans new insight into his life and career. <br><br>In this evocative collection, Maclean as both a writer and a man becomes evident. Perceptive, intimate essays deal with his career as a teacher and a literary scholar, as well as the wealth of family stories for which Maclean is famous. Complete with a generous selection of letters, as well as excerpts from a 1986 interview, <i>The Norman Maclean Reader </i>provides a fully fleshed-out portrait of this much admired author, showing us a writer fully aware of the nuances of his craft, and a man as at home in the academic environment of the University of Chicago as in the quiet mountains of his beloved Montana. <br><br>Various and moving, the works collected in <i>The Norman Maclean Reader</i> serve as both a summation and a celebration, giving readers a chance once again to hear one of American literature&#x2019;s most distinctive voices. </p></p><p><b>Norman Maclean</b> (1902-1990), woodsman, scholar, teacher, and storyteller, grew up in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana. As a young man, he&nbsp;worked in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. He was awarded&nbsp;an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. He was the William Rainey Harper Professor of English at the University of Chicago, teaching the Romantic poets and Shakespeare.&nbsp;After his retirement in 1973, he began to write the stories he liked to tell, which became the book <i>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</i>, published to widespread acclaim. The book was the first work of original fiction published by the University of Chicago Press. It was nominated by a selection committee to receive the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977, but the full committee ignored the nomination and did not award a Pulitzer in that category for the year. In the last years of his life, he wrote an account of the 1949 Mann Gulch forest fire. It was published posthumously as <i>Young Men and Fire</i>, and won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.<p>&#x201c;Smartly edited . . . the book brings together manuscripts and letters found among Maclean&#x2019;s papers after his death in 1990, as well as hard-to-find essays, lectures and interviews. Maclean did not draw a distinction between his life and his fiction, and the material in the <i>Reader</i>, much of it available for the first time, burnishes his achievement.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bringing together letters, essays, speeches, and five draft chapters from his unfinished first book, the collection shows a man worrying through the mechanics of putting a story together. All writers may be self-obsessed, but in the case of Maclean, the rough and unfinished works, the drama of his revisions and deliberations lead us back to a central dynamic of his most finished work. Maclean&#x2019;s stories are precisely about the difficulties and obstructions of storytelling. As such, he is a more difficult but more rewarding writer than one known simply for old-time tales of a lost American west. . . . <i>The Norman Maclean Reader </i>fills out and makes more human the impressions of the restless, inquiring storyteller we saw in previously published works. In his writings, at their best, we too feel the thrusts and strains. He is a writer of great beauty, in his own terms.&#x201d; (Daniel Swift <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"Maclean (1902-1990), an English professor at the University of Chicago, did not establish himself as a writer until late in his life, but quickly gained national acclaim in 1989 [sic] for <i>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</i>. His posthumous nonfiction account of doomed firefighters, <i>Young Men and Fire</i>, was also praised by critics. Excerpts from both of these works are in this anthology, skillfully edited by Weltzien, to provide a broad and chronological selection from nearly four decades of Maclean's writing. The book includes six previously unpublished pieces, five of them chapters from his uncompleted book on Custer, written between 1959 and 1963. Another standout piece is a 1986 interview in which Maclean ranges widely from the rhythms of prose, his own influences and his native state of Montana to creative writing, fly-fishing, and publishers who rejected <i>A River Runs Through It.</i> Readers of the two earlier books will find, as Weltzien phrases it, 'new biographical insights into one of the most remarkable and unexpected careers in American letters.'" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A solid, satisfying, well-made body of work by a patient craftsman." (Julia Keller <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>"Fans will find a fleshed-out picture of the author's approach to writing, teaching, art and life. New readers will be introduced to one of our most accomplished storytellers, plying his craft across a range of genres. . . . The addition of <i>The Norman Maclean Reader</i> to the author's two slim published books is a windfall." (Tim Nulty <i>Seattle Times</i>)<br><br>"Weltzien has not only done great service for Norman Maclean's readers, he has rightly expanded Maclean's place in American literature. . . . For me, <i>The Norman Maclean</i> reader is discovered treasure." (Tom Wylie <i>Bloomsbury Review</i>)<br><br>"[Maclean's] message is certainly tough . . . but it comes garlanded in a prose style very near to unsurpassed in the rhythms of its rolling anapests, its bright flashes of remembrance, its whispers out of time." (Philip Connors <i>Nation</i>)<br><br>"On every page . . . we hear Maclean's voice&#x2014;a voice that tells us . . . that our well-ordered loves reside at the intersection of people we know and the places we share with them."

Traditional imaging and tracking systems have given way to infinitely more powerful "dataveillance" technologies, as an evolving arsenal of surrogate eyes and ears in our society shifts its focus from military to domestic space. Taking as its point of departure an architectural drawing by Jeremy Bentham that became the model for an entire social regime, CTRL [SPACE] looks at the shifting relationships between design and power, imaging and oppression, from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries.<br> <br> From the photographs taken with hidden cameras by Walker Evans and Paul Strand in the early twentieth century to the appropriation of military satellite technology by Marko Peljhan a hundred years later, the works of a wide range of artists have explored the dynamics of watching and being watched. The artists whose panoptical preoccupations are featured include, among others, Sophie Calle, Diller + Scofidio, Dan Graham, Pierre Huyghe, Michael Klier, Rem Koolhaas, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Thomas Ruff, Julia Scher, Andy Warhol, and Peter Weibel. This book, along with the exhibition it accompanies, is the first state-of-the-art survey of panopticism&#x2014;in digital culture, architecture, television, video, cinema, painting, photography, conceptual art, installation work, robotics, and satellite imaging.</p><p>Thomas Y. Levin is Associate Professor of German at Princeton University where he teaches media and cultural theory. His most recent book CTRL [SPACE]: Rhetorics of Surveillance from Bentham to Big Brother (MIT Press, 2002) is the catalogue of a major exhibition which he curated at the ZKM in Karlsruhe (Germany).Published in conjunction with an exhibition at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, this timely catalog of the emerging genre of surveillance art is the first to compile critical essays discussing the history of surveillance, dating from Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon in 1787 to the present. The catalog includes many well-known Western artists and offers exposure to some who are lesser known. Curator and coeditor Levin has gathered a mixture of important original and previously published essays by some of the most respected postmodern theorists in this collection, among them Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Victor Burgin, and Slavoj Zizek. The layout mirrors the sensibility of the exhibit but is distracting, with overlapping type that can actually make reading the book difficult. This mammoth catalog includes biographies of the artists and authors, 950 illustrations (350 in color), and an exhibition checklist.

Essays, image-text projects, photographic dossiers, and philosophical and scientific articles examine the multiple emergences over the last 100 years of new models of life based on technological and biological developments, whose roots go back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but whose full expression is only beginning to emerge. These new transformations and modalities are discussed and figured in relation to an older set of models that long ago began to dissolve - the classical notions of unity, interiority, and organism. In its heterogeneous approach, Zone 6: Incorporations provides a rich cartographic description of the particular capacities and trajectories of the contemporary body drawing on the work of neurologists, anthropologists, filmmakers, architects, philosophers, historians, biologists, dancers, novelists, and artists.ContributorsPaul Rabinow, Eve Sedgwick, Fran�ois Dagognet, Peter Eisenman, J.

Wells moves from protests at the White House gates to antiwar meeting halls, recreating the activities of the student factions, religious organizations, political splinter groups, and other organizations that waged campaigns of mass protest, draft resistance, civil disobedience, and sometimes political violence. Here, too, are the behind-the-scenes planning sessions of Democratic and Republican administrations as they sought to discredit and subvert the antiwar movement's efforts.<br><br>Wells demonstrates that Washington took the antiwar movement seriously at every stage of the war and that the movement was instrumental in the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia. He also reveals how the movement's growing influence prompted the Watergate fiasco. And he graphically conveys the internecine conflicts that plagued the antiwar movement and its leaders.<br><br>In these pages the human drama of the antiwar era unfolds through the words of its participants, both the famous and the forgotten. Wells not only captures the spirit of these tumultuous times but also shows how the events of twenty-five years ago shaped the America of today.</p><p>"Tom Wells' book is the <i>War and Peace</i> of the movement to end American involvement in Vietnam. Like Tolstoy, he offers a massive cast of characters and a plethora of detail, but also a coherent theme.

Semenza prepares graduate students and recent graduates for what they really seek: a successful academic car</p><p>Five characteristics distinguish <i>Graduate Study for the 21st Century</i>. First, this is a book designed solely for graduate students who wish to become professors on the tenure track; it does not spend time on alternative career paths for terminal M.A.s or Ph.D.s. Second, the unique focus on building a professorial career means that this book dedicates a significant amount of attention to professional development issues, including publishing, attending conferences, and job searching. In a straightforward and non-condescending manner, it emphasizes how a smart and informed "streamlining" approach to graduate study and teaching can lead to both a meaningful (and relatively short) graduate career and the sort of professional accomplishments that will make you a standout on the job market. Third, <i>Graduate Study for the 21st Century</i> is the only guide that recognizes the specific needs of students in the humanities. It does not assume that the concerns of a history student (or professor) are the same as those of an individual specializing in chemistry or engineering. Fourth, this book deliberately counters the tendency of the aforementioned guides to present an image of graduate school as unrelated to and unaffected by the brutal realities of late 20th-century and 21st-century politics and corporate economics. One gets the impression from previous graduate school guides that academe is no different today from what it was fifty or seventy-five years ago. Finally, this book operates at a level of detail simply not found in any of the aforementioned works. Focusing in depth on such important practical matters as selecting the right seminars, making the most of exams, and constructing effective CV&#x2019;s, teaching portfolios, and job applications, the emphasis of this book is very much on how to succeed in graduate school.Gregory Colon Semenza is Assistant Professor of English, University of Connecticut.</p><h2>The Israel Bible - Hebrew English Translated Bible : Honoring the Land, the People, and the God of Israel</h2><p>The Israel Bible is the world&#39;s first Bible centered around the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the dynamic relationship between them.

The action research processes described in this book are honed by many years of successful application, and provide teachers, educational leaders, families and community members with a set of tools for engaging with significant problems in classrooms and schools.&nbsp; This book is designed to provide the reader with an understanding of the nature of action research and the procedures and applications of action research.&nbsp; In addition, it provides practical resources that add to the fundamentals of knowledge available to action researchers.&nbsp; The text is detailed, providing specific guidance for many of the skills that may be required for the different contexts and problems to which action research can be applied.&nbsp; Conceptual frameworks provide a "compass" or "roadmap" that will enable practitioners to keep track of action research processes applied to their work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Research&#x2014;A Personal History</b></p> <p> Research has been part of my life since my childhood. At school I "researched" topics for class, carefully gathering material and sorting through it to select the most relevant information with which to formulate papers or presentations. In a high school physics class, I engaged in a small experiment with my teacher and classmates on a sports field. We used an empty can and a stopwatch to estimate the speed of sound. At that time, I also became fascinated by theories and experiments in cosmology and particle physics, which began a life-long fascination with explanations of the nature of the physical universe. As I write this book, I am struggling to read and understand <i>Fire in the Mind</i> (Johnson, 1995), which seeks to elucidate the ways scientists try to explain the puzzling phenomena coming to them from the infinitely regressive micro-world of particle physics, and to juxtapose these explanations with theories emerging from their investigations of deep space&#x2014;the cosmos. </p> <p> These first forays into the field of research expanded dramatically when I entered university and teacher training. In these contexts, I explored material derived from a wide range of experiments in the behavioral sciences, providing information about intelligence, personality, learning processes, child development, teaching strategies, and a host of related topics. This information helped me to grasp some of the fundamental features of human life&#x2014;to know how and why people behaved as they did&#x2014;and enabled me to understand more clearly how I could teach children effectively. This knowledge, sometimes laboriously acquired in education, psychology, and sociology classes, provided a wealth of information that still informs my educational practices. I've learned to understand the varying capabilities, capacities, and behaviors of young children as they grow into adulthood. I understand more clearly the conditions under which learning takes place and the different factors influencing educational achievement. As an experienced educator, I now draw from a considerable stock of knowledge as I organize the teaching/learning processes with the diverse groups of students who enter my classes. </p> <p> When I entered graduate school, my first research methods classes showed how these experiments were constructed and enacted and showed me how survey research, sometimes called quasi-experimental research, could further extend my understanding of the very complex problems involved in educating diverse populations. I learned how to perform research investigating the effects of factors like social class, gender, culture, and language on educational achievement, and to structure investigations exploring their relationship to employment, income, health status, and so on. Not only were my research skills increasing dramatically, but I was able to link knowledge available from research studies to theories of education, human behavior, and the social world. </p> <p> Research, therefore, has informed my educational practices and made them increasingly sophisticated and effective. I have become aware, however, of the limitations of the often abstract and highly generalized nature of much of the information I derive from the research literature. Much of it is compelling and makes a great deal of sense within the sophisticated and complex explanations contained with the theories of the academic disciplines&#x2014;psychology, sociology, anthropology. But I have also learned that much of this theory is often irrelevant and lacks meaning or utility when applied to many of the deep-seated and long-term problems people experience in classrooms and schools. </p> <p> Although I became aware of these limitations as a graduate student at the University of Illinois, the full force of this paradox became apparent in the early 1980s when I started to engage in work in Aboriginal communities in remote regions of Australia. In these contexts, the sophistication and breadth of my academic expertise proved illusory, and the concepts and theories of behavioral and social theory were lacking in substance or function. As I helped people in these places come to grips with the difficult and multifaceted problems they faced in their everyday community life, I learned a decisive lesson about the nature of knowledge and its application to everyday life. I learned that the sophisticated knowledge emanating from academic understandings often had little relevance in these contexts. </p> <p> Even today, if you visit a remote Aboriginal community you will see the tattered remnants of community gardens developed with great skill using the best information and technology available from horticultural science. What is not evident is the place of <i>gardening</i> in the life of a desert people still heavily instilled with the cultural perspectives of the hunter-gatherer. You can see their counterparts in schools in urban and suburban America, where dusty boxes of unused materials remind us of yet another quick-fix program developed and funded, for a time, to deal superficially with some deep-seated educational issue. </p> <p> At this time, I also learned how people's own knowledge and wisdom were often more useful in working toward solutions to the problems they faced. A clear instance emerged during a visit to a remote community where the people, becoming tired of the inadequate and damaging education provided for their children, set up a school themselves. Despite inadequate classroom accommodation and a dearth of books, materials, and equipment, the community school provided one of the most exciting educational experiences for children I have witnessed. Although they were assisted in this process by a non-Aboriginal teacher who lived with them and provided her expertise, the school was structured and operated on the basis of educational processes and a style of operation that "made sense" to the lifestyle and life-ways of local people&#x2014;their culture. Though very different, in many respects, from traditional schools, it was very effective in providing an effective and relevant education for the children of this community. </p> <p> At that time, I was unaware that I had witnessed what was, in effect, the outcome of an action research process. The people had started with a problem&#x2014;providing adequate schooling for their children&#x2014;and worked toward a solution. They also gained information and expertise as they acquired the understanding necessary to organize their school. Each of the many questions involved in developing a fully functioning school&#x2014;how to build classrooms, how to hire and pay a teacher, how to develop a curriculum, how to organize a timetable of learning, and more&#x2014;became subjects of investigation. As they developed their understanding of each of these issues, people were able to map out the actions required to bring this part of the puzzle into operation. They started with a little understanding of what they wished to achieve and worked systematically to acquire the knowledge leading to a solution to their problem&#x2014;a classical action research process. </p> <p> That experience has changed the way I now view research and the way I engage in research processes. For me, the process of research central to my professional and community life is participatory action research. It requires me to work with people to assist them in making use of their own understandings and expertise&#x2014;to use their experience and local wisdom to work systematically through a process of investigation to acquire deeper, broader, and more effective understandings that enable them to develop workable solutions to the problems they investigate. </p> <p> Although I still appreciate my extensive academic and professional knowledge, I engage it warily, sensitive to the need for people to conceptualize and understand issues in terms that make sense in their everyday lives. I, therefore, provide my professional expertise gently and with humility&#x2014;always providing opportunities for people to reject or modify ideas I might inject into an investigation. In a recent community-based research project, I provided neighborhood parents with a list of questions to use in interviews. I presented them as examples of the type of questions they might ask and was pleased to see them accept the general approach to interviewing, but to tell me "You can't ask that question like that! You'd have to say. . . ," and then start to formulate questions of their own. </p> <p> Research has become a much broader set of activities than those I initially learned in my experimental and survey research classes. According to the issue, the context, and the purpose of research I may now choose from a wide array of approaches and methods to satisfy the needs of the project in hand. Since I largely work as a consultant, however, helping people find solutions to particular problems, I rarely engage in experimental or survey research. In school settings, I assist educators and families in improving their educational practices or in evaluating, planning, or implementing educational programs and services. This is the work that informs my educational understandings and forms the basis for the examples and illustrations of action research processes in this book. </p> <p> The effectiveness of this approach to research is demonstrated by the degree to which teachers in the United States have been able to apply successfully my models of research. Their work extends in range and variety across age groups, grade and school levels, and across regions. Educators from preschool to university graduate classes successfully apply research processes to enhance their educational practices or to find solutions to significant problems. Stories from their experience permeate the pages of this book and illustrate the ways action research has been used in schools. </p> <p> The stories also include accounts, however, of the way action research has been used in the community to assist educators in making effective links with parents and other neighborhood groups. Stories demonstrate the continuing ways ...</p></p><h2>Study Guide for Zumdahl&#39;s Chemistry, 5th</h2><p>DUST JACKET AND PAGES ARE CLEAN AND TIGHT!!!

Photos.</p><p><p><b>Kathleen Brady</b> was named a Fellow of the Society of American Historians for her biography <i>Ida Tarbell Portrait of a Muckraker.</i> She was featured on the PBS American Masters Series tribute to Lucille Ball, as well as on the PBS series The Prize and the A &amp; E Biography series. She is a former reporter for Time Magazine and was co-director of New York University's Biography Seminar. She writes about issues affecting New York City where she makes her home.</p>Lucille Ball was the quintessential hardworking, wisecracking gal who knocked herself out to get a break, caught fame's shooting star, and rode it for all it was worth. Meanwhile, she worked herself harder than a Horatio Alger hero, becoming an extremely successful businessperson who suffered the now-familiar distancing from her children, who later said they couldn't remember her ever just playing with them. The first TV megastar, Ball became so familiar that her nickname, Lucy, instantly brought her to mind. Her offscreen persona was the antithesis of the TV Lucy, though, and after a while, she wasn't even Lucy on TV anymore. Yet the show, the drive, and the grind kept going, for the money kept rolling in. Eventually, her enjoyment of it all evaporated as the toll of her stormy marriage to Desi Arnaz and the problems of her children, whose entertainment careers she tried to start and manage, mounted. Ball's life is a captivating, ultimately cautionary tale; its similarity to the plot of a showbiz potboiler makes it all the more appealing. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>From Quarks to the Cosmos: Tools of Discovery (Scientific American Library)</h2><p>Particle physicists explore the microworld of the atom; cosmologists study the universe on a grand scale.

This is a condition that Frank himself aspires to. But at thirty-eight, he suffers from incurable dreaminess, occasional pounding of the heart, and the not-too-distant losses of a career, a son, and a marriage. In the course of the Easter week in which Ford's moving novel transpires, Bascombe will end up losing the remnants of his familiar life, though with his spirits soaring.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>It&#39;s hard to imagine a book illuminating the texture of everyday life more brilliantly, or capturing the truth of human emotions more honestly, than Ford does in his account of an alienated scribe in the New Jersey suburbs. Frank Bascombe, Ford&#39;s protagonist, clings to his almost villainous despair in a way that Walker Percy&#39;s men don&#39;t, but the book is heavily influenced by Ford&#39;s fellow southerner nonetheless.

Under the editorship of Herbert Golder and the late William Arrowsmith, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays.<br> One of Euripides' late plays, <em>Ion</em> is a complex enactment of the changing relations between the human and divine orders and the way in which our understanding of the gods is mediated and re-visioned by myths. The story begins years before the play begins, with the rape of the mortal Kreousa, queen of Athens, by Apollo. Kreousa bears Apollos' child in secret then abandons it. Unbeknownst to her, Apollo has the child brought to his temple at Delphi to be reared by the priestess as ward of the shrine. Many years later, Kreousa, now married to the foreigner Xouthos but childless, comes to Delphi seeking prophecy about children. Apollo, however, speaking through the oracle, bestows the temple ward, Ion, on Xouthos as his child. Enraged, Kreousa conspires to kill as an interloper the very son she has despaired of finding. After mother and son both try to kill each other, the priestess reveals the birth tokens that permit Kreousa to recognize and embrace the child she thought was dead. Ion discovers the truth of his parentage and departs for Athens, as a mixed blood of humanity and divinity, to participate in the life of the polis.<br> In <em>Ion</em>, disturbing riptides of thought and feeling run just below the often shimmering surfaces of Euripidean melodrama. Although the play contains some of Euripides' most beautiful lyrical writing, it quivers throughout with near disasters, poorly informed actions and misdirected intentions that almost result in catastrophe. Kreousa says at one point that good and evil do not mix, but Euripides' argument, and what the youthful Ion strives to understand, is that human beings are not only compounded of good and evil, but that the two are often the same thing differently experienced, differently understood, just as beauty and violence are mixed both in the gods and in the mortal world.<br></p><p>One of Euripides&#39; late plays, Ion tells the story of Kreousa, queen of Athens, and her son by the god Apollo. Apollo raped Kreousa; she secretly abandoned their child, assuming thereafter that the god had allowed him to die. Ion, however, is saved to become a ward of Apollo&#39;s temple at Delphi. In the play, Kreousa and her husband Xouthos go to Delphi to seek a remedy for their childlessness; Apollo, speaking through his oracle, gives Ion to Xouthos as a son, enraging the apparently still childless Kreousa. Mother tries to kill son, son traps mother at an altar and is about to do her violence; just then, Apollo&#39;s priestess appears to reveal the birth tokens that permit Kreousa to recognize and embrace the child she thought she had lost forever. Ion must accept Apollo&#39;s duplicity along with his benevolence toward his son. Disturbing riptides of thought and feeling run just below the often shimmering surface of this masterpiece of Euripidean melodrama. Despite Ion&#39;s &#34;happy ending&#34;, the concatenation of mistaken identities, failed intrigues, and misdirected violence enacts a gripping and serious drama. Euripides leaves the audience to come to terms with the shifting relations of god and mortals in his complex and equivocal interpretation of myth.<br><strong>W.S. Di Piero</strong> is Professor of English at Stanford University.<br></p><h2>The Visioneers: How a Group of Elite Scientists Pursued Space Colonies, Nanotechnologies, and a Limitless Future</h2><p><p>In 1969, Princeton physicist Gerard O'Neill began looking outward to space colonies as the new frontier for humanity's expansion. A decade later, Eric Drexler, an MIT-trained engineer, turned his attention to the molecular world as the place where society's future needs could be met using self-replicating nanoscale machines. These modern utopians predicted that their technologies could transform society as humans mastered the ability to create new worlds, undertook atomic-scale engineering, and, if truly successful, overcame their own biological limits. <i>The Visioneers</i> tells the story of how these scientists and the communities they fostered imagined, designed, and popularized speculative technologies such as space colonies and nanotechnologies.</p><br><p> Patrick McCray traces how these visioneers blended countercultural ideals with hard science, entrepreneurship, libertarianism, and unbridled optimism about the future. He shows how they built networks that communicated their ideas to writers, politicians, and corporate leaders. But the visioneers were not immune to failure--or to the lures of profit, celebrity, and hype. O'Neill and Drexler faced difficulty funding their work and overcoming colleagues' skepticism, and saw their ideas co-opted and transformed by Timothy Leary, the scriptwriters of <i>Star Trek</i>, and many others. Ultimately, both men struggled to overcome stigma and ostracism as they tried to unshackle their visioneering from pejorative labels like "fringe" and "pseudoscience.?</p><br><br><p> <i>The Visioneers</i> provides a balanced look at the successes and pitfalls they encountered. The book exposes the dangers of promotion--oversimplification, misuse, and misunderstanding--that can plague exploratory science. But above all, it highlights the importance of radical new ideas that inspire us to support cutting-edge research into tomorrow's technologies.</p></p><p><p>"In <i>The Visioneers</i>, Patrick McCray introduces us to a host of innovators who pushed back against the language of limits. Their techno-enthusiast ventures, unfolding in the closing decades of the twentieth century, combined technical skill, bold speculation, and public-relations savvy. By tracing their inspirations, missteps, and unconventional networks, McCray offers a rich and fascinating cultural history of technological aspirations at a critical turning point in American history."<b>--David Kaiser, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"This wonderful and unique book uncovers the complex array of activities scientific dreamers undertake in convincing the world that their visions of technological utopias can, and should, become realities. McCray tells a masterful story about how 'visioneers' rely on their scientific expertise and detailed engineering plans to legitimate their evocative tales of technological salvation in the face of ecological disasters."<b>--David A. Kirby, author of <i>Lab Coats in Hollywood</i></b></p><p>"In this compulsively readable history, Patrick McCray tells the remarkable, intertwined story of the 'visioneers,' improbable dreamers whose aspirations for a transformative future surprisingly helped create the world of today. His American panorama sweeps us from the malaise of the 1970s through the go-go 1980s and the technocratic 1990s. We end up in our present, richer for the journey."<b>--Michael Gordin, Princeton University</b></p><p>"<i>The Visioneers</i> is an enthralling tale of visionaries fighting against the gravity of habit and convention, cajoling the rest of us to create a new and better future. It is at once compelling history and a reminder that if one aims high and far enough, even failures can lead to unintended society-changing successes."<b>--Paul Saffo, managing director, <i>Discern</i></b></p><p>"Having been a cheerleader for the grand schemes recounted in this book, I'm happy to be a cheerleader for the book itself. It is accurate, thorough, and insightful. Since this century is certain to produce many new cadres of visioneers, the book will lend perspective on how best to critique and harness their dreams."<b>--Stewart Brand, author of <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i></b></p><p>"McCray presents a fast-moving, compelling, and highly readable account of scientific movements in space colonization and nanotech. In each case, he argues that a single individual--a visioneer--brought the movement into existence and drove its rise to popularity through a mix of networking, promotion, and engineering."<b>--Fred Turner, author of <i>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</i></b></p><p>"McCray tells the engaging story of Gerard O'Neill and K. Eric Drexler and the people they knew and worked with as they launched scientific, technological, and social movements in space exploration and nanotechnology. He has mined most if not all of the available sources and interviewed many of the key players. <i>The Visioneers</i> is a major contribution."<b>--Peter Bishop, coeditor of <i>Thinking about the Future</i></b></p><p>"This is the foremost study of its kind in terms of detail, depth, and intellectual significance. McCray illuminates the challenges these visioneers faced in conceiving of their respective visions, defending them against critics and rivals, and learning to balance partial victories and partial defeats. Readers come to understand these figures as human beings beyond coming to understand their ideas, projects, and crusades."<b>--Howard P.

When the task was to establish the text and to discuss the authenticity of the documents, linguistic and historical considerations came first. Now that these things are approaching a settled state it has become possible, and necessary, to give more attention to the theological and religious content of the New Testament. Hence the New Testament is re-examined by scholars in this new series. Each volume takes a book of the New Testament and, after an introduction on general matters, goes through the text in great detail, commenting especially on theological matters, relating the contents to the life and worship of the early Christian communities. It is assumed that students have their own Greek text beside the open commentary.

Since the triumph of Castro, politicians and historians have accused the left there of rejecting democracy, embracing communist totalitarianism, and prompting both revolutionary violence and a right-wing backlash. Through unprecedented archival research and gripping personal testimonies, Greg Grandin powerfully challenges these views in this classic work. In doing so, he uncovers the hidden history of the Latin American Cold War: of hidebound reactionaries holding on to their power and privilege; of Mayan Marxists blending indigenous notions of justice with universal ideas of equality; and of a United States supporting new styles of state terror throughout the region.</p> <p>With Guatemala as his case study, Grandin argues that the Latin American Cold War was a struggle not between political liberalism and Soviet communism but two visions of democracy&#x2014;one vibrant and egalitarian, the other tepid and unequal&#x2014;and that the conflict&#x2019;s main effect was to eliminate homegrown notions of social democracy. Updated with a new preface by the author and an interview with Naomi Klein, <i>The Last Colonial Massacre</i> is history of the highest order&#x2014;a work that will dramatically recast our understanding of Latin American politics and the role of the United States in the Cold War and beyond.</p> <p>&#x201c;This work admirably explains the process in which hopes of democracy were brutally repressed in Guatemala and its people experienced a civil war lasting for half a century.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>International History Review</i></p> <p><i> </i></p> <p>&#x201c;A richly detailed, humane, and passionately subversive portrait of inspiring reformers tragically redefined by the Cold War as enemies of the state.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Journal of American History</i></p></p><p>Latin America today is seen by many as the crown jewel of the U.S. effort to spread freedom throughout the world. During the Cold War, the argument goes, the United States defeated Latin American communism, paving the way for the region's embrace of capitalist democracy and making Latin America the model to be emulated around the globe. <i>The Last Colonial Massacre</i> mounts a powerful challenge to this view.<br><br>Through unprecedented archival research and gripping personal testimonies, Greg Grandin uncovers a hidden history of the Latin American Cold War: of hidebound reactionaries holding on to their power and privilege; of Mayan Marxists blending indigenous notions of justice with universal ideas of equality; and of a United States supporting new styles of state terror throughout the continent. Drawing from declassified U.S. documents, Grandin exposes Washington's involvement in the 1966 secret execution of over thirty Guatemalan leftists, prefiguring later disappearances in Chile and Argentina.<br><br>With Guatemala as his case study, Grandin also argues that the Latin American Cold War was a struggle not between political liberalism and Soviet communism but two visions of democracy&#x2014;one vibrant and egalitarian, the other tepid and unequal. And ultimately the conflict's main effect was to eliminate home-grown notions of social democracy. Grandin provocatively concludes that the definition of democracy now being extolled as the best weapon in the war against terror is itself a product of terror.<b>Greg Grandin</b> is professor of history at New York University.

While founder Cornelius Vander Starr&#x2014;who led this Shanghai start-up for fifty years&#x2014;built an extraordinary insurance franchise, it was his hand-picked successor, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, who would turn that franchise into one of the world's most profitable and powerful financial services companies.</p> <p>Now, in Fallen Giant, author Ron Shelp&#x2014;who worked alongside Greenberg and within the AIG organization for more than a decade&#x2014;sheds light on AIG, the company, and Hank Greenberg, the man.

But a spirit of uneasiness, discontent, and world-weariness soon arose and has persisted in Europe, in America, and elsewhere for two decades. To discern the meaning of this malaise we must investigate the nature of liberal democracy, says the author of this provocative book, and he undertakes to do so through a detailed investigation of the thinking of Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Tocqueville.</p><p>Paul A. Rahe argues that these political thinkers anticipated the modern liberal republic's propensity to drift in the direction of &#x201c;soft despotism&#x201d;&#x2014;a condition that arises within a democracy when paternalistic state power expands and gradually undermines the spirit of self-government. Such an eventuality, feared by Tocqueville in the nineteenth century, has now become a reality throughout the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.&nbsp;So Rahe asserts, and he&nbsp;explains what must be done to reverse this unfortunate trend.</p></p><p><b>Paul A.

Shryock details such developments as the founding of the first medical school in America (at the College of Philadelphia in 1765); the introduction of inoculation against smallpox in Boston in 1721; the creation of the Marine Hospital Service in 1799, under which all merchant marines were required to take out health insurance; and the state of medical knowledge on the eve of the Civil War.</p></p><p><p>The late Richard Harrison Shryock taught at The Ohio State University, Duke University, the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania, and The Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>"In three chapters covering the period 1660&#x2013;1820 and one covering 1820&#x2013;1860, Shryock lucidly describes medical thought and practice, the composition of the profession, as well as its education, regulation, research (or lack of it), institutions, organizations, and publications. He discusses health conditions among the general population and the efforts made to improve these conditions by public and private measures. These topics are carefully related to one another, to the general background of American society, and to their European origins or counterparts.

James Fisher surveys more than four centuries of Catholics&#39; involvement in American history, starting his narrative with one of the first Spanish expeditions to Florida, in 1528. He follows the transformation of Catholicism into one of America&#39;s most culturally and ethnically diverse religions, including the English Catholics&#39; early settlement in Maryland, the Spanish missions to the Native Americans, the Irish and German poor who came in search of work and farmland, the proliferation of Polish and Italian communities, and the growing influx of Catholics from Latin America. The book discusses Catholic involvement in politics and conflict, from New York&#39;s Tammany Hall to the Vietnam War and abortion. Fisher highlights the critical role of women in American Catholicism--from St. Elizabeth Seton and Dorothy Day to Mother Cabrini, the first American citizen to be canonized a saint--and describes the influence of prominent American Catholics such as Cardinal John J. O&#39;Connor, 1930s radio personality Father Charles Coughlin, President John F. Kennedy, pacifists Daniel and Philip Berrigan, activist Cesar Chavez, and author Flannery O&#39;Connor.</p><p><br><em>James T.

More than two centuries in the development of modern forensic procedures come to vivid life as everything from handwriting analyses and voiceprints to ballistics, DNA testing, and psychological profiles reveal whodunit (and, in some startling cases, who didn't do it).<br> <br> "Pithy, concise, and remarkably accurate." -Science Books &amp; Films<br> <br> "Contains ample material to hold the attention and foster interest in science." -Science Teacher</p><p>Anyone can summarize a collection of cases, but not everyone can make them read well. With a flair for compressed narrative worthy of a good short story writer, Colin Evans entertains and instructs the reader with 100 cases that exemplify the use of 15 different forensic techniques (ballistics, fingerprinting). Some (like the Lindbergh case) are famous, others are barely known, yet each has some unique twist that sets it apart. Many &#34;firsts&#34; are included, such as the first murder conviction without a body, the first use of psychological profiling, and the first use of DNA typing. Evans also brings out the distinct (often flamboyant) personalities of the pioneering experts of forensics and some of their more notable courtroom theatrics. Each case is labeled by name of criminal, forensic technique, date, location, and significant feature(s), making this a useful reference as well as a fun book to read.This fascinating book describes the development of forensics from the nineteenth century to the present. Cases are classified by 15 forensic types then arranged chronologically. Features riveting stories of how forensic experts were able to identify a person with only one one thousandth of her body parts, the dramatic tale of how a psychological profile helped catch a dangerous criminal who drank his victim&#39;s blood, and numerous more narratives of how science triumphed to bring the guilty to justice and free the innocent.</p><h2>White Noise</h2><p>&#39;An extraordinarily funny book on a serious subject, effortlessly combining social comedy, disaster, fiction and philosophy ...hilariously, and grimly, successful&#39; Daily Telegraph Jack Gladney is the creator and chairman of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill. This is the story of his absurd life; a life that is going well enough, until a chemical spill from a rail car releases an &#39;Airborne Toxic Event&#39; and Jack is forced to confront his biggest fear his own mortality. White Noise is an effortless combination of social satire and metaphysical dilemma in which DeLillo exposes our rampant consumerism, media saturation and novelty intellectualism. It captures the particular strangeness of life lived when the fear of death cannot be denied, repressed or obscured and ponders the role of the family in a time when the very meaning of our existence is under threat. &#39;An astonishing novel ...unforgettable ...nearly every page crackles with memorable moments and perfectly turned phrases ...dizzying, darkly beautiful fiction&#39; Sunday Times</p><p>Better than any book I can think of, <i>White Noise</i> captures the particular strangeness of life in a time where humankind has finally learned enough to kill itself. Naturally, it's a terribly funny book, and the prose is as beautiful as a sunset through a particulate-filled sky. Nice-guy narrator Jack Gladney teaches Hitler Studies at a small college. His wife may be taking a drug that removes fear, and one day a nearby chemical plant accidentally releases a cloud of gas that may be poisonous. Writing before Bhopal and Prozac entered the popular lexicon, DeLillo produced a work so closely tuned into its time that it tells the future.9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Handbook of Workplace Assessment</h2><p><p>Praise for Handbook of Workplace Assessment</p> <p>"Wow&#x2014;what a powerhouse group of authors and topics!

Despite billions of dollars invested in medical research, no effective treatment has been discovered for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. <i>The Alzheimer Conundrum </i>exposes the predicaments embedded in current efforts to slow down or halt Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease through early detection of pre-symptomatic biological changes in healthy individuals.</p><p>Based on a meticulous account of the history of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and extensive in-depth interviews, Margaret Lock highlights the limitations and the dissent associated with biomarker detection. Lock argues that basic research must continue, but should be complemented by a public health approach to prevention that is economically feasible, more humane, and much more effective globally than one exclusively focused on an increasingly harried search for a cure.</p></p><p><p>"Bringing together an anthropology of predictive medicine with a social study of science, and discussing recent biological discoveries as well as crucial public health problems, <i>The Alzheimer Conundrum</i> offers an insightful approach to the uncertain boundaries between aging and dementia, and brilliantly revisits the philosophical theme of the normal and pathological. Evocatively written, it is a major contribution to the understanding of one of the most perplexing and tragic issues of our time."<b>--Didier Fassin, Institute for Advanced Study</b></p><p>"<i>The Alzheimer Conundrum</i> is a must-read for all who are interested in how society and researchers frame the investigation of Alzheimer's disease and its effects on the aging global population. Lock has woven the individual threads of the scientific discussion and debate about dementia into a magnificent tapestry, prompting us to question our assumptions and perceptions. A compelling book."<b>--Carol Brayne, University of Cambridge</b></p><p>"<i>The Alzheimer Conundrum</i> is an eye-opening analysis of the tangles of diagnoses and treatments for Alzheimer's as they are experienced by clinicians, researchers, patients, and their families. Lock's nuanced exploration of the risk and uncertainty surrounding genetic knowledge about the brain brings the anthropology of medicine and science to an entirely new and unsurpassed level."<b>--Emily Martin, author of <i>Bipolar Expeditions</i></b></p><p>"A riveting plunge into the genomics and neuroscientific epidemiology of this much-feared disease, Margaret Lock's <i>The Alzheimer Conundrum</i> convincingly shows why scientists are unlikely to untangle the causes of Alzheimer's disease anytime soon. This superb contribution to science studies exposes the existential dilemma we all confront: what will our globalized societies do to care for our rapidly aging populations?"<b>--Rayna Rapp, New York University</b></p><p>"This book is an excellent treatment of the intricacies of Alzheimer's disease--what it is, what it isn't, what it might be--and deals with its genetic, diagnostic, and predictive uncertainties.

The West has succumbed to a sort of international socialism. The forces of secular materialism, relativism and state control are everywhere triumphant. Protestantism is no more, and Catholicism which had made some major advances in the first half of the twentieth century has been devastated by the development of new psychologies and the exodus of intellectuals in the wake of an Ecumenical Council. Euthanasia has become an instrument of the state, Esperanto the universal second language. Nevertheless, although organised religion has largely collapsed in the face of institutional secularism, a vague, humanistic religiosity militantly hostile to the exclusive and supernatural claims of the Church is present everywhere. Finally, the East, which has amalgamated into a single, pantheistic bloc, continues to pose a military threat.

All stories, Aristotle said, have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but most ends are relative, the terminus of this chain of acts or that. But what of the end that terminates all human action as we know it, the end of time itself, the Second Coming? Since this novel appeared in 1906, many others have been devoted to nuclear disaster, destructive comets, and other hair-raising possibilities. What sets Benson&#x2019;s story apart and makes it as readable today as when it was written is the Catholic and biblical context that provides the ultimate meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#x2013;1914) was the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his conversion to Catholicism caused a stir. He became a great apologist for the faith, in spiritual works as well as in works of the imagination. Lord of the World is first of all a tremendous &#x201c;read,&#x201d; but it is also spiritual food for thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late Ralph McInerny contributed a fine preface to the work, and recently Fr. C. John McCloskey III, a specialist on the work of Robert Hugh Benson, added a fascinating introduction.<br>&nbsp;</p>LORD OF THE WORLD is a bitingly satiric science fiction novel of a secularized world state. As Rosa Mulholland, Lady Gilbert, declared, "It is a brilliant, beautiful, and terrible book," a judgment in which the public has fully concurred for nearly a century. LORD OF THE WORLD is the only one of Benson&#x2019;s novels to remain continually in print from its first publication in 1907 down to the present day. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen declared, "The three great apocalyptic pieces of literature dealing with the advent of the satanic are Father Hugh Benson&#x2019;s LORD OF THE WORLD, Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV, and Soloviev&#x2019;s THREE CONVERSATIONS ON WAR."</p><h2>Social Work Skills for Beginning Direct Practice: Text, Workbook, and Interactive Web Based Case Studies (3rd Edition) (Connecting Core Competencies)</h2><p><p><strong> <em>NOTE:</em></strong><strong><em>This is a standalone book.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em></em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Social work practice skills text/workbook plus web-based case studies</em> </strong></p> <p><strong> <em>&nbsp;</em> </strong></p> <p>This book is part of the Connecting Core Competencies Series.

Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life - Readings</h2><p><p></p> <p></p> <p>This carefully edited companion anthology focuses on everyday experiences, important sociological issues, and hallmark historical events. </p> <p></p> <p>Providing provocative, eye-opening examples that illuminate the relationship between the individual and society, this <b>Ninth Edition </b>includes a mix of short articles, chapters, and excerpts.

It addresses comprehensively, authoritatively, and authentically the issues students face in college mathematics. The ideas in this guide, grounded in research and experience, could very well keep students from receiving an undesirable grade, dropping a course, changing an area of concentration, or dropping out of college. This book will help students realize fully the mathematics potential that lies within them. <p> There are many gems of wisdom for the struggling to the strong college mathematics student. Students will find out how to: improve as problem solvers, manage assignments, determine if they have course prerequisites, write mathematics, work with symbolic form, read their textbooks, get the most out of class, make the most of their learning styles, work with classmates, select and work with instructors, whether to drop a course, retake a course, decrease procrastination and anxiety, increase confidence and motivation, prepare for and take examinations, and manage time, a job, and scheduling of courses.</p><p>The primary organization of the book is this: A key topic is presented in a thorough way, and is often referenced again when related topics are presented in thorough ways. Hence, this spiraling effect reinforces knowledge of the topic. The book has an extensive table of contents and index, clearly revealing the issues that are discussed and where they can be found. Chapters may be related to each other, but they stand alone. Hence, readers can begin to read at virtually any place in the book, and move back and forth to chapters or sections of interest to them.</p><p>Support for the relevance of the learning and study issues discussed includes: remarks from successful college mathematics students on what worked for them in their college mathematics courses, and from unsuccessful college mathematics students on what did not work for them; statements by college mathematic students, which came from their free responses to questions on forms used to evaluate their instructors and courses; suggestions from experienced college mathematics instructors on issues they believe need to be addressed; the formal academic training, research activities, and extensive college teaching experience of the author in mathematics and mathematics education.</p><p>This resource is not only valuable for college mathematics students, but also for high students intending to take college mathematics, college and high school preservice and inservice mathematics instructors, and college and high school counselors and other academic support personnel.</p><p>The book is more than an introduction to learning mathematics. It is also about learning how to learn, and becoming a successful college student in general. Success in mathematics means more than receiving a good course grade; therefore, any student can learn what his or her deficiencies are and how to overcome them. </p><p>If you find a better resource book for undergraduate mathematics students (and instructors), buy it! And let us know about it. Because right now there is simply nothing else out there.</p></p><p>Professor Richard M. Dahlke has an extensive formal academic background in mathematics and mathematics education. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, with a Bachelor of Science Degree in mathematics, and a teaching certificate in secondary school mathematics. He holds a Master of Arts degree in teaching mathematics from California State University, San Diego, and a Master of Science degree in mathematics and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in mathematics education from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He taught high school mathematics in Wisconsin for three years and college mathematics for the next thirty-six years. His first two years of college teaching were at the State University of New York, College at Buffalo.<p>As a college professor of mathematics for thirty-four years at the University of Michigan, Dearborn, he taught all the courses in the calculus track lower-division mathematics program to students pursuing degrees in mathematics, engineering, natural sciences and business.

He has published widely in academic journals on a variety of mathematics and mathematics education subjects. </p><p>Professor Dahlke is a strong advocate for college students, including their right to receive quality mathematics instruction. He believes that learning is a partnership among the student, classmates, and the instructor, and that the efforts of students to organize and manage their time is critical to success in college. He further believes that students should enjoy college. In order for that to happen students should not get stressed out or too alarmed when things do not go well. They need to focus their energies on making necessary changes that will improve their college experience and lessen stress and anxiety. The end result will be successful college students with contented spirits.</p><p>He has served on the Board of Directors of CRISPAZ (Christians for Peace in El Salvador).

This growing series is rigorously updated, with scholarly introductions and notes added to new titles.</p><p><b>Thomas Hardy</b> was born on June 2, 1840. In his writing, he immortalized the site of his birth&#x2014;Egdon Heath, in Dorset, near Dorchester. Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school. At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing. An extremely productive novelist, Hardy published an important book every year or two. In 1896, disturbed by the public outcry over the unconventional subjects of his two greatest novels&#x2014;<b>Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles</b> and <b>Jude the Obscure</b>&#x2014;he announced that he was giving up fiction and afterward produced only poetry. In later years, he received many honors. He died on January 11, 1928, and was buried in Poet&#x2019;s Corner, in Westminster Abbey. It was as a poet that he wished to be remembered, but today critics regard his novels as his most memorable contribution to English literature for their psychological insight, decisive delineation of character, and profound presentation of tragedy.<p></p>`What a joy it is to find World's Classics according to `new edition' status to that gentle romantic tale, A Pair of Blue Eyes, our enjoyment of which is enhanced by the editing and fine general and textual introductions by Alan Manford, whose knowledge and enthusiasm conspire to urge a revaluation of a novel which deserves a much wider readership.'

Rarely, however, do people think of Mae West as a writer. In <strong>Three Plays By Mae West,</strong> Lillian Schlissel brings this underexplored part of West's career to the fore by offering for the first time in book form, three of the plays West wrote in the 1920s--<em>Sex</em> (1926), <em>The Drag</em> (1927) and <em>Pleasure Man</em> (1928). With an insightful introduction by Schlissel, this book offers a unique look into to the life and early career of this legendary stage and screen actress.</p><p><strong>Lillian Schlissel</strong> is Director of the American Studies Program, Brooklyn College.How many movie buffs know that Mae West was as much a writer as she was a performer--and that she was a soulful woman of originality, courage, and integrity, boldly going against the moral grain of her times by portraying independent, sexually confident women and presenting homosexuals as people worthy of respect? This volume gives a glimpse of the real Mae West by publishing her three radical, melodramatic, but quite hilarious plays for the first time. They were staged between 1926 and 1928, but each production was closed down, leading to West's arrest and several high-profile court appearances, during which she fought obscenity charges with pride and conviction. It is easy to see why these startling plays outraged the authorities but delighted audiences. West uses the peppery argot of her native ground, the streets of Brooklyn and New York, to great effect, while tackling truly hard-hitting themes. In "Sex" a whore falls in love and goes straight; "The Drag" depicts a love triangle involving a homosexual, his naive and miserable heterosexual wife, and a man they both find attractive; and "The Pleasure Man" explores the dire implications of outrageous promiscuity. It's true that West was no angel: she was an artist and a woman of conviction and honor. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Israel Biblical Sites Bible Companion</h2><p><p>The Holy Land is much more than places and historical artifacts; it&#x2019;s an experience . . .&nbsp; an experience that is spiritual in nature for those with eyes to see.

Hemingway&#39;s men are bullfighters and boxers, hired hands and hard drinkers, gangsters and gunmen. Each of their stories deals with masculine toughness unsoftened by woman&#39;s hand. Incisive, hard-edged, pared down to the bare minimum, they are classic Hemingway territory.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.<b>From Men Without Women: The Undefeated</b> <p>Manuel Garcia climbed the stairs to Don Miguel Retana's office. He set down his suitcase and knocked on the door. There was no answer. Manuel, standing in the hallway, felt there was some one in the room. He felt it through the door.</p> <p>"Retana," he said, listening.</p> <p>There was no answer.</p> <p>He's there, all right, Manuel thought.</p> <p>"Retana," he said and banged the door.</p> <p>"Who's there?" said some one in the office.</p> <p>"Me, Manolo," Manuel said.</p> <p>"What do you want?" asked the voice.</p> <p>"I want to work," Manuel said.</p> <p>Something in the door clicked several times and it swung open. Manuel went in, carrying his suitcase.</p> <p>A little man sat behind a desk at the far side of the room. Over his head was a bull's head, stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls were framed photographs and bull-fight posters.</p> <p>The little man sat looking at Manuel.</p> <p>"I thought they'd killed you," he said.</p> <p>Manuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk. The little man sat looking at him across the desk.</p> <p>"How many corridas you had this year?" Retana asked.</p> <p>"One," he answered.</p> <p>"Just that one?" the little man asked.</p> <p>"That's all."</p> <p>"I read about it in the papers," Retana said. He leaned back in the chair and looked at Manuel.</p> <p>Manuel looked up at the stuffed bull. He had seen it often before. He felt a certain family interest in it. It had killed his brother, the promising one, about nine years ago. Manuel remembered the day. There was a brass plate on the oak shield the bull's head was mounted on. Manuel could not read it, but he imagined it was in memory of his brother. Well, he had been a good kid.</p> <p>The plate said: "The Bull ?Mariposa' of the Duke of Veragua, which accepted 9 varas for 7 caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia, Novillero, April 27, 1909."</p> <p>Retana saw him looking at the stuffed bull's head.</p> <p>"The lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will make a scandal," he said. "They're all bad in the legs. What do they say about them at the Caf�?"</p> <p>"I don't know," Manuel said. "I just got in."</p> <p>"Yes," Retana said. "You still have your bag."</p> <p>He looked at Manuel, leaning back behind the big desk.</p> <p>"Sit down," he said. "Take off your cap."</p> <p>Manuel sat down; his cap off, his face was changed. He looked pale, and his coleta pinned forward on his head, so that it would not show under the cap, gave him a strange look.</p> <p>"You don't look well," Retana said.</p> <p>"I just got out of the hospital," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I heard they'd cut your leg off," Retana said.</p> <p>"No," said Manuel. "It got all right."</p> <p>Retana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of cigarettes toward Manuel.</p> <p>"Have a cigarette," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>Manuel lit it.</p> <p>"Smoke?" he said, offering the match to Retana.</p> <p>"No," Retana waved his hand, "I never smoke."</p> <p>Retana watched him smoking.</p> <p>"Why don't you get a job and go to work?" he said.</p> <p>"I don't want to work," Manuel said. "I am a bull-fighter."</p> <p>"There aren't any bull-fighters any more," Retana said.</p> <p>"I'm a bull-fighter," Manuel said.</p> <p>"Yes, while you're in there," Retana said.</p> <p>Manuel laughed.</p> <p>Retana sat, saying nothing and looking at Manuel.</p> <p>"I'll put you in a nocturnal if you want," Retana offered.</p> <p>"When?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"Tomorrow night."</p> <p>"I don't like to substitute for anybody," Manuel said. That was the way they all got killed. That was the way Salvador got killed. He tapped with his knuckles on the table.</p> <p>"It's all I've got," Retana said.</p> <p>"Why don't you put me on next week?" Manuel suggested.</p> <p>"You wouldn't draw," Retana said. "All they want is Litri and Rubito and La Torre. Those kids are good."</p> <p>"They'd come to see me get it," Manuel said, hopefully.</p> <p>"No, they wouldn't. They don't know who you are any more."</p> <p>"I've got a lot of stuff," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I'm offering to put you on tomorrow night," Retana said. "You can work with young Hernandez and kill two novillos after the Charlots."</p> <p>"Whose novillos?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. Whatever stuff they've got in the corrals. What the veterinaries won't pass in the daytime."</p> <p>"I don't like to substitute," Manuel said.</p> <p>"You can take it or leave it," Retana said. He leaned forward over the papers. He was no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel had made to him for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone. He would like to get him to substitute for Larita because he could get him cheaply. He could get others cheaply too. He would like to help him though. Still he had given him the chance. It was up to him.</p> <p>"How much do I get?" Manuel asked. He was still playing with the idea of refusing. But he knew he could not refuse.</p> <p>"Two hundred and fifty pesetas," Retana said. He had thought of five hundred, but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty.</p> <p>"You pay Villalta seven thousand," Manuel said.</p> <p>"You're not Villalta," Retana said.</p> <p>"I know it," Manuel said.</p> <p>"He draws it, Manolo," Retana said in explanation.</p> <p>"Sure," said Manuel. He stood up. "Give me three hundred, Retana."</p> <p>"All right," Retana agreed. He reached in the drawer for a paper.</p> <p>"Can I have fifty now?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"Sure," said Retana. He took a fifty-peseta note out of his pocket-book and laid it, spread out flat, on the table.</p> <p>Manuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.</p> <p>"What about a cuadrilla?" he asked.</p> <p>"There's the boys that always work for me nights," Retana said. "They're all right."</p> <p>"How about picadors?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"They're not much," Retana admitted.</p> <p>"I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.</p> <p>"Get him then," Retana said. "Go and get him."</p> <p>"Not out of this," Manuel said. "I'm not paying for any cuadrilla out of sixty duros."</p> <p>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel across the big desk.</p> <p>"You know I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.</p> <p>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel from a long way off.</p> <p>"It isn't right," Manuel said.</p> <p>Retana was still considering him, leaning back in his chair, considering him from a long way away.</p> <p>"There're the regular pics," he offered.</p> <p>"I know," Manuel said. "I know your regular pics."</p> <p>Retana did not smile. Manuel knew it was over.</p> <p>"All I want is an even break," Manuel said reasoningly. "When I go out there I want to be able to call my shots on the bull. It only takes one good picador."</p> <p>He was talking to a man who was no longer listening.</p> <p>"If you want something extra," Retana said, "go and get it. There will be a regular cuadrilla out there. Bring as many of your own pics as you want. The charlotada is over by 10.30."</p> <p>"All right," Manuel said. "If that's the way you feel about it."</p> <p>"That's the way," Retana said.</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow night," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I'll be out there," Retana said.</p> <p>Manuel picked up his suitcase and went out.</p> <p>"Shut the door," Retana called.</p> <p>Manuel looked back. Retana was sitting forward looking at some papers. Manuel pulled the door tight until it clicked.</p> <p>He went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of the street. It was very hot in the street and the light on the white buildings was sudden and hard on his eyes. He walked down the shady side of the steep street toward the Puerta del Sol. The shade felt solid and cool as running water. The heat came suddenly as he crossed the intersecting streets. Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he passed.</p> <p>Just before the Puerta del Sol he turned into a caf�.</p> <p>It was quiet in the caf�. There were a few men sitting at tables against the wall. At one table four men played cards. Most of the men sat against the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups and liqueur-glasses before them on the tables. Manuel went through the long room to a small room in back. A man sat at a table in the corner asleep. Manuel sat down at one of the tables.</p> <p>A waiter came in and stood beside Manuel's table.</p> <p>"Have you seen Zurito?" Manuel asked him.</p> <p>"He was in before lunch," the waiter answered. "He won't be back before five o'clock."</p> <p>"Bring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary," Manuel said.</p> <p>The waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big coffee-glass and a liqueur-glass on it. In his left hand he held a bottle of brandy. He swung these down to the table and a boy who had followed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny, spouted pots with long handles.</p> <p>Manuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned forward on his head. He winked at the coffee-boy </p> <p>as he poured out the brandy into the little glass beside Manuel's coffee. The coffee-boy looked at Manuel's pale face curiously.</p> <p>"You fighting here?" asked the waiter, corking up the bottle.</p> <p>"Yes," Manuel said. "Tomorrow."</p> <p>The waiter stood there, holding the bottle on one hip.</p> <p>"You in the Charlie Chaplins?" he asked.</p> <p>The coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.</p> <p>"No. In the ordinary."</p> <p>"I thought they were going to have Chaves and Hernandez," the waiter said.</p> <p>"No. Me and another."</p> <p>"Who? Chaves or Hernandez?"</p> <p>"Hernandez, I think."</p> <p>"What's the matter with Chaves?"</p> <p>"He got hurt."</p> <p>"Where did you hear that?"</p> <p>"Retana."</p> <p>"Hey, Looie," the waiter called to the next room, "Chaves got cogida."</p> <p>Manuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them into his coffee. He stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and warming in his empty stomach. He drank off the brandy.</p> <p>"Give me another shot of that," he said to the waiter.</p> <p>The waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full, slopping another drink into the saucer. Another waiter had come up in front of the table. The coffee-boy was gone.</p> <p>"Is Chaves hurt bad?" the second waiter asked Manuel.</p> <p>"I don't know," Manuel said, "Retana didn't say."</p> <p>"A hell of a lot he cares," the tall waiter said. Manuel had not seen him before. He must have just come up.</p> <p>"If you stand in with Retana in this town, you're a made man," the tall waiter said. "If you aren't in with him, you might just as well go out and shoot yourself."</p> <p>"You said it," the other waiter who had come in said. "You said it then."</p> <p>"You're right I said it," said the tall waiter. "I know what I'm talking about when I talk about that ...</p></p><h2>Looseleaf for Mass Media Law</h2><p><i>Mass Media Law</i>, in its twenty-first edition, examines the First Amendment freedoms of the press, speech and assembly, extremely relevant in an era of &#x201c;fake news&#x201d; and open hostility by some politicians toward the fourth estate.

Content and Language Integrated Learning</h2><p>CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) has emerged since the millennium as a major trend in education. Written by Do Coyle, Philip Hood and David Marsh and drawing on their experience of CLIL in secondary schools, primary schools and English language schools across Europe, this book gives a comprehensive overview of CLIL. It summarises the theory which underpins the teaching of a content subject through another language and discusses its practical application, outlining the key directions for the development of research and practice. This book acknowledges the uncertainty many teachers feel about CLIL, because of the requirement for both language and subject knowledge, while providing theoretical and practical routes towards successful practice for all.</p><p>A comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the theory and practice of CLIL.</p><h2>The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative (Cambridge Introductions to Literature)</h2><p>This study is designed to help readers understand what narrative is, how it is constructed, how it acts upon us, how we act upon it, how it is transmitted, and how it changes when the medium or the cultural context change. Porter Abbott emphasizes that narrative is found not only in the arts but everywhere in the ordinary course of people&#39;s lives. An indispensable tool for students and teachers alike, this book will guide readers through the fundamental aspects of narrative.</p><p>"Abbott brilliantly zeroes in on the architecture of narrative with an exactness and bent for orderly exposition that utterly redeems his subject....The result is a superb taxonomy of what narrative means today." Chronicle of Higher Education<br><br>"Directness, accessibility, and coherence distinguish this brief but comprehensive study of narrative. It is very much the 'introduction' its title asserts because Abbott is consistent in his efforts to identify, explain and define. His approach is down-to-earth, even conversational, and yet he integrates terms or references intrinsic to the study of narrative. The plethora of examples and illustrations - both 'classic' and contemporary, drawn from cirtical and theoretical texts, novels, short stories...films and television - is a major strength making narrative concepts clear....Most highly recommended." Choice<br><br>"Written in an unfailingly lucid style that nonetheless refuses to 'dumb down' the major research questions facing analysts of stories, this book provides an ideal starting-point for readers seeking a synoptic overview of<br><br>recent scholarship on narrative. More than just a primer for readers unfamiliar with previous research on stories, however, Abbott's book itself represents a significant contribution to the field of narrative studies." David Herman, Symploke<br><br>"A lucid, practical, wide-ranging, and...original introduction to narrative, which will be useful to undergraduate and graduate courses on literary theory and criticism. This is not a dry textbook, however; the reader is made aware of a real voice and of a fascination with the role of narrative across many cultures and beyond." Derek Attridge</p><h2>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</h2><p>For the first time in 70 years, a new translation of Max Weber's classic <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>--one of the most enduring and influential books in sociology--is available. Translator Stephen Kalberg is an internationally acclaimed Weberian scholar. In this Third Edition, Kalberg offers a precise and nuanced rendering of <em>The Protestant Ethic</em> that captures Weber's style as well as the unusual subtlety of his descriptions and causal arguments. Kalberg's standardization of Weber's terminology facilitates understanding of the various twists and turns in his complex lines of reasoning. Weber's original italicization, highlighting major themes, has been restored. A glossary of major terms has been added. In short, <em>The Protestant Ethic</em> thesis is presented in a clear and highly readable manner.<br> <br> There are three compelling reasons to read this classic:<br> <br> * It explores the continuing debate regarding the origins and legacy of modern capitalism in the West.<br> * It helps the reader better understand economic development today around the world, especially in Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America.<br> * It plumbs the deep cultural forces that affect contemporary work life and the workplace in the United States and Europe.<br> <br> In his introduction, Kalberg examines the controversy that has surrounded this book for nearly a century and summarizes major aspects of Weber's complex analysis. Kalberg also discusses <em>The Protestant Ethic</em> in the context of Weber's other writings. Finally, Kalberg investigates the contribution of this classical study for understanding the role played by cultural forces in modern economic development and discusses the wide-ranging impact today of ascetic Protestantism on the American work ethic. The Third Roxbury Edition includes Weber's 1906 essay "The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism." Written after his extensive travels in the United States in 1904, Weber comments here on the diverse ways in which the legacies of early American Protestantism remain influential. Also included in this edition are Weber's masterful prefatory remarks to his <em>Collected Essays in the</em> <em>Sociology of Religion</em>, in which he defines the uniqueness of Western Societies and asks what "ideas and interests" combined to call forth modern Western rationalism.<br> <br> For students, <em>The Protestant Ethic</em> is a starting point toward understanding the multiple dimensions of social change. The continuing debates about the main elements of modern life--capitalism, our "common sense" economic determinism and "rational choices," relationships between cultural forces and social structures, the tension between religion and science, the cultural foundations of democracy, economic cultures and business ethics, and the future of modern capitalism--are very much part of the Weberian project. Small wonder, then, that <em>The Protestant Ethic</em> continues to be one of the most frequently assigned readings in sociology.</p><p>Stephen Kalberg is at Boston University.</p><h2>Modern Persian: Spoken and Written, Volume 2 (Yale Language)</h2><p>Although Persian is one of the world&#x2019;s oldest languages, in its modern form it is still spoken by more than forty million people in Iran and by more than twenty million people elsewhere.

She lives in Arnold, MD. Troy Taylor is an author and the founder of the American Ghost Society.Arranged alphabetically, this compilation of facts pertaining to actual investigations and theories as well as the history of ghosts and hauntings greatly expands the first edition. Entries vary between a few sentences (<i>Afrit</i> , an Arabian demon) and to nearly two pages (<i>Hyslop, James Hervey</i> [1854-1920], who conducted physical research). Many entries are followed by references for further reading, including Web sites. A few illustrations and photos are provided, and <i>see</i> references are frequent. The writing style is very readable, and browsers may find themselves reading the entire work.The only really comparable publication is the British publication <i>Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits</i> by John and Anne Spencer (Headline, 1993), which came out a year after Guiley's first edition. It needs updating and is not nearly as comprehensive as Guiley's new edition. If the first edition was well used, buy reference and circulating copies of the second at this reasonable price.

But this obsessive focus was a major cause of the abuses that nearly sunk the global economy in 2008. In this analytically rigorous and eminently practical book, Bruno Roche and Jay Jakub offer a more complete form of capitalism, one that delivers superior financial performance precisely <i>because</i> it mobilizes and generates&nbsp;human, social, and natural capital along with financial capital. They describe how the model has been implemented in live business pilots in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. Recent high-profile books like <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> have exposed financial capitalism&#x2019;s shortcomings, but this book goes far beyond by describing a well-developed, field-tested alternative.</p><p>Bruno Roche&nbsp;has been the chief economist of Mars, Inc., since 2006 and leads Catalyst, a global thought leadership capability and internal&nbsp;think tank for Mars, Inc., where the ideas in this book were first proposed. Roche also&nbsp;is part of&nbsp;the World Economic Forum.<br> Jay Jakub is the senior director of external research at Mars, Inc./Catalyst. He joined the&nbsp;Catalyst corporate think tank in 2007 and coleads with Roche this pioneering new business model initiative. He is also&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;Spies and Saboteurs.&#x201c;A major breakthrough on creating an economy that works for all. The thinking is rigorous and backed up by careful research on how mutuality-based practices in social, human, natural, and financial capital can change the economic well-being of society. This work now sets the gold standard for how the private sector can go beyond lip service in making a major positive impact on the world.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Peter Block, author of Flawless Consulting and Community <br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;The world is rapidly changing, and business must adapt to the new rules of the game or fall behind. Roche and Jakub give us a blueprint for sustainable corporate prosperity. It&#x2019;s an approach that can deliver greater value to society and the environment and also deliver superior business returns&#x2014;a &#x2018;win-win-win&#x2019; for all stakeholders in a corporate value chain. But to do this, you must work with the right people. This new way of operating a business is applicable to all sectors of the economy. It is not just about doing good but is good for business.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Olivier Goudet, CEO, JAB Group, and Chairman, Anheuser-Busch InBev <br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;Courageously reconciles dimensions that were thought to be mutually exclusive for centuries.

Their clear, concise, values-driven words shape capitalism into its final form and elevate it to the pinnacle position that it deserves. Roche&#x2019;s and Jakub&#x2019;s superb scholarship is underpinned and supported by the practical reality of successful pilots and business world applications. They not only complete capitalism, they create and hand us a road map for responsible business in the 21st century.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Dr. Frank Akers, former Associate Director, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Chairman, Mars Science Advisory Council; CEO, Oak Ridge Strategies Group; and Brigadier General, US Army (ret.)<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;For Veolia, the world leader in environmental services, the question of innovation in service of human progress&nbsp;is central: expanding access to natural resources, preserving and renewing them is our vocation. Our values at Veolia are in profound harmony with the great essay of Bruno Roche and Jay Jakub, <i>Completing Capitalism</i>, which proposes a vision and practical solutions for a responsible capitalism based on reciprocity and shared prosperity.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Dinah Louda, Executive Director, Veolia Institute, and advisor to the CEO of Veolia<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;The more complete form of capitalism put forward by Roche and Jakub is not about competitive advantage. But to be competitive in the future, companies will need to operate this way.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Paul Michaels, former CEO, Mars, Incorporated, and former executive, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;As human beings we long for the way the world is supposed to be, even as we make choices against that hope. For years Bruno Roche and Jay Jakub have been hard at work thinking and rethinking the way that business should be and ought to be&#x2014;if we are to flourish as selves and societies, choosing a future that understands the grain of the universe. With a rare willingness to ask the most critical questions about the nature of business, their &#x2018;economics of mutuality&#x2019; is a vision for doing good and doing well in the context of one of the most iconic brands in the modern world. Neither charity nor corporate social responsibility, but rather a way for sustained profitability, <i>Completing Capitalism</i> argues for making money in a way that remembers the meaning of the marketplace.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Dr. Steven Garber,&nbsp;Principal, The Washington Institute, and author of Visions of Vocation and The Fabric of Faithfulness<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;Some endeavors require intellectual, emotional, or spiritual courage. Bruno and Jay have demonstrated all three in fleshing out this valuable piece of work on behalf of Mars, Incorporated, our associates, and all stakeholders, including the planet. I truly hope it evolves, as I believe it can and must, the dialogue regarding capitalism&#x2019;s future and its crucial role in our world going forward.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Stephen Badger, Chairman of the Board, Mars, Incorporated<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;This crisis is more than a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; crisis. It requires a reset of our thoughts and ways of doing. Business as usual does not work anymore or anywhere. The journey that Jay Jakub and Bruno Roche are proposing is a difficult one but a promising and fecund one. It is ambitious but within our reach to make this world a better one. This is, I believe, the only reasonable option. We have patched up the system. This is the good news. We have to rebuild. This is the promising appeal. A properly functioning market economy must work for the many, not just for the few. Now is the time if we want to eradicate poverty in our generation.

The elderly Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert had planned on adopting a boy to help Matthew with the chores on their Prince Edward Island farm. What are they to do with the red-haired, high-spirited girl who arrives instead?<br><br>Anne Shirley, with her boundless imagination and heart, slowly brings joy into the narrow lives of those around her, and into the lives of readers who have delighted in her adventures since Lucy Maud Montgomery began writing about her in 1905.<br><br>Anne&#x2019;s courage, her enthusiasm, and her ability to love, have made her one of literature&#x2019;s most beloved characters in Canada and around the world.<br><br>This beautifully illustrated volume, with a foreword by Kate Butler MacDonald, one of L. M. Montgomery&#x2019;s grandchildren, is a treasure for those who find in Anne a familiar friend as well as for those who are discovering this &#x201c;kindred spirit&#x201d; for the first time.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Also challenging the contemporary &#x201c;lean-in,&#x201d; trickle-down feminist philosophy and asserting that women&#x2019;s histories all too often depoliticize politics, labor issues, and divergent economic circumstances, Dorothy Sue Cobble, Linda Gordon, and Astrid Henry demonstrate that the post-Suffrage women&#x2019;s movement focused on exploitation of women in the workplace as well as on inherent sexual rights. The authors carefully revise our &#x201c;wave&#x201d; vision of feminism, which previously suggested that there were clear breaks and sharp divisions within these media-driven &#x201c;waves.&#x201d; Showing how history books have obscured the notable activism by working-class and minority women in the past, <em>Feminism Unfinished</em> provides a much-needed corrective. 20 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Dorothy Sue Cobble</strong> lives in Princeton, New Jersey, and teaches at Rutgers University, where she is the Distinguished Professor of History and Labor Studies.</p><p><strong>Linda Gordon</strong>, winner of two Bancroft Prizes and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize, is the author of <em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em>, <em>Dorothea Lange</em> and <em>Impounded</em>, and the coauthor of <em>Feminism Unfinished</em>.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p><p>Tony Hillerman (1925&#x2013;2008), an Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident since 1963, was the author of 29 books, including the popular 18-book mystery series featuring Navajo police officers Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, two non-series novels, two children&#x2019;s books, and nonfiction works. He had received every major honor for mystery fiction; awards ranging from the Navajo Tribal Council's commendation to France 's esteemed <em>Grand prix de litterature policiere. </em>Western Writers of America honored him with the Wister Award for Lifetime achievement in 2008. He served as president of the prestigious Mystery Writers of America, and was honored with that group&#x2019;s Edgar Award and as one of mystery fiction&#x2019;s Grand Masters. In 2001, his memoir, <em>Seldom Disappointed, </em>won both the Anthony and Agatha Awards for best nonfiction.</p>Vibrant with the spirit of the Navajo people of the Southwest, Hillerman's new story is a spellbinder, like his Edgar Winner Dance Hall of the Dead and other praised novels. Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the tribal police work together here, trying to solve crimes that resist logic. There are no clues to three homicides or to the attempted murder of Chee. Leaphorn thinks a "skinwalker," or witch, could have attacked the victims, all adherents of shamanism, as they are otherwise unrelated. The skinwalkers represent a schism between witchcraft and the traditional Navajo Way. A second attempt on Chee bolsters Leaphorn's suspicion since Chee is an aspiring shaman. The story gathers momentum and tension as the partners get closer to the moment when the murderer comes into the open, and the tragic reason for the crimes becomes painfully clear. 30,000 first printing; BOMC alternate; author tour. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Captive of Time</h2><p>She is "Lara"--Boris Pasternak's model for the unforgettable heroine of DOCTOR ZHIVAGO.

This groundbreaking work is written by Noel Tyl, one of the world&#x2019;s most respected astrologers, adding to his list of twenty-three texts that have informed two generations of astrologers.</p> <p>Over 700 creative connections are offered in this text to guide astrologers through planetary and aspect symbolisms into a deep analysis of the human condition. As part of modern astrological practice and in the context of actual client-session transcripts&#x2015;the first ever presented in the literature&#x2015;Tyl presents numerous clearly developed techniques, including:<br><br>&#x2015;Preparation for consultation<br>&#x2015;Techniques for questioning&nbsp;<br>&#x2015;Methods for inviting disclosure<br>&#x2015;Presentation skills<br>&#x2015;Effective ways to explore therapeutic connections</p> <p>Along with analysis, remediation, and healing, Tyl discusses the difficult topic of the practicality of behavioral predictions, how to frame them within client realities, and how to invite involvement from the client. Astrology is presented here in its most creative and constructive context, in which therapeutic holistic consultation is far more important than the abject description of varied chart factors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>As we move more and more into the new millennium, both astrology and psychology have come of age. They are both valid paradigms for understanding the human condition and the individual mind. As such, they support each other and can amplify each other for consultation over mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual concerns. <br> <br>Noel Tyl has brought psychological methodology into astrological symbolism and analysis. His classic texts on astrology have shaped two generations of astrologers. Now he crowns his combination of counseling and astrology with <i>The Creative Astrologer,</i> a master volume that places particular emphasis on creative and concise techniques of counseling. <br> <br>The purpose of this book is to go beyond psychological descriptions, to give ways of dealing with challenges. It shares the information you need to be able to combine astrology and counseling, including how to prepare, how to present information, and how to get your client to do things beneficial to his or her future. <br> <br>Although the focus is clearly on astrologers, anyone who does counseling&#x2014;including Tarot readers, palmists, etc.&#x2014;will find this book helpful. You will want <i>The Creative Astrologer</i> to make your counseling even better. <br>Noel Tyl is one of the foremost astrologers in the world. His twenty textbooks have guided astrologers for two generations, and his lecture activities reach out through sixteen countries and some 200,000 miles a year. <br> <br>Tyl has written the definitive professional manual in the astrology counseling field, the 1,000 page Synthesis &amp; Counseling In Astrology; is consulted regularly by individuals and corporations throughout the world, and directs the Master&#x2019;s Degree Correspondence Course for Certification of professional astrologers from his office in the Phoenix, Arizona area. <br> <br>Tyl, a Harvard &nbsp;University graduate, is also the Presiding Officer of AFAN ( The Association for Astrological Networking), astrology&#x2019;s world organization. His most recent titles include Solar Arcs, Predictions for a New Millennium, and Astrology of Intimacy, Sexuality, &amp; Relationship, all published by Llewellyn Publications. <br> <br></p><h2>Black Money</h2><p>A low-level government investigator looking at the books of a failed Northern California bank stumbles upon an account that has no explanation. It is a tiny thread that will ultimately unravel a criminal tapestry of unbelievable audacity, complexity, and scope, a conspiracy ranging from the cocaine fields of the Andes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.<br>Few other novelists today know as much about the intersection of big money and global crime as Michael M. Thomasand none can match his storytelling power. Charged with action, surprise, and inside knowledge, Black Money gathers an unlikely team of heroes, led by Lee Boynton, a wealthy heiress turned journalist, and Thurlow Coole, a Wall Street wizard turned computer-fraud expert. They find themselves challenging a criminal alliance that, in a diabolically clever scheme, is laundering billions of drug dollars through a skein of businesses ranging from Wall Street firms to fast-food stores.<br>At a relentless pace, Black Money leads us into the inner coils of the vast global web, along whose filaments trillions of dollars move every day, and into the brain of JEDI, the top-secret government computer network the penetration of which lies at the heart of the plot.<br>This is a whole new kind of techno-thriller - one in which the weapon is more awesome than any missile.</p><p>The crime-fighting supercomputer named JEDI is the key to a web of electronic fraud where trillions of dollars are at stake. For a fast adventure with financial crime, espionage and high-tech computer maneuvering, Black Money will delight listeners. Theodore Bikel has a distinct accent that doesn&#39;t seem to suit the California or Washington settings, but his talents as narrator surmount his inflection. He&#39;s able to keep the listener engrossed with the compelling thriller with masterful pacing and vocal portraits. The abridgment is smooth and except for being over too soon, completes a great program. R.F.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineAnother elegant entertainment from Thomas (Hanover Place, 1990, etc.), a former Lehman Brothers partner with a firm grasp of high finance and the low cunning that frequently informs it. Lee Boynton is a brainy, zaftig, 30ish heiress, copublisher and sole angel of Washington-based Capitol Steps, a muckraking review with a small but influential readership. When she gets a tip on some odd megabuck cash flows through a troubled bank in Northern California, she recruits Thurlow Coole, an austere Bostonian with a Wall Street background, to help her pursue the story. The unlikely pair quickly realize they're on the twisty trail of a criminal enterprise established mainly to legitimize Colombian drug lords' money, flight capital from underdeveloped countries, terrorists' slush funds, and the illicit profits of putatively respectable corporations. At the heart of the vast conspiracy is Credit Provencal, a BCCI-like institution effectively controlled by Mona Kurchinsky, a whip-smart operator who was a valued prot&#x201a;g&#x201a;e of Lee's legendary uncle in the CIA. Mona's minions include a White House insider and a murderous Korean-American who has tapped into JEDI (Joint Expedited Date Interface), the US government's ultrasecure clearinghouse system for its law-enforcement agencies. As the transnational laundry's dirty linen comes spilling out in the wash of Lee's globe-trotting inquiries and Coole's shrewd analyses of what's been going down in the presumptive privacy of computer networks, the villains of the piece begin covering their tracks the old-fashioned way--by killing off those who know too much. At the close, Lee has written a bestseller about how CP was brought to book and looks forward to deepening her lusty relationship with an unexpectedly studly Coole. Good nasty fun in the form of a plausible (if not altogether credible) plot offering object lessons on the wages of sin, laced with liberal measures of the author's trademark commentary on tempora et mores. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Le Guin</strong> was born in Berkeley, California, in 1929. Among her honors are a National Book Award, five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, the Kafka Award, a Pushcart Prize, and the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Portland, Oregon. <strong>www.ursulakleguin.com</strong>IF YOU'D LIKE a story about how I won my basketball letter and achieved fame, love, and fortune, don't read this. I don't know what I achieved in the six months I'm going to tell about. I achieved something, all right, but I think it may take me the rest of my life to find out what.<br><br> I never won any letters for anything. When I was a little kid, I really liked touch football, the strategy of it, but being short for my age I was always a bit slow even though I was good at evasive tactics. And then when we got into high school, it all got so organized. Going out for teams and wearing uniforms and all that stuff. And people talk about it all the time. Sports are neat to do, but dull to talk about. Anyhow there won't be much about sports in this.<br><br> I am talking into a tape recorder and then typing it. I tried to just write it, but it came out all stuffy and clotted-up with words, so let's see how it goes this way. My name is Owen Thomas Griffiths. I was seventeen in November. I am still fairly short for my age-"5 7". I guess I will be short for my age when I'm forty-five, so what's the difference? It bothered me a lot when I was twelve or thirteen, but I was much shorter then compared to other kids, a genuine shrimp. At fifteen I grew six inches in eight months and felt really awful while I was doing it; my knees used to feel like the Bamboo Splinter Torture, but when it was over I was such a giant compared to what I had been that I never could really regret not going on any higher. I am average compact build and have dirty gray eyes and a lot of hair. The hair is curly, and whether I wear it short or long it sticks out all over my head. I fight it with a hairbrush every morning, and lose. I like my hair. It has a lot of willpower. However, this story is not about my hair, either.<br><br> I am always the youngest person in my class. And the youngest person in my family, being the only child. They let me into school early because I was such a bright little jerk. I have always been bright for my age. Who knows, at forty-five I may still be bright for my age. That is partly what this thing I'm telling, this story, is about. About being a bright little jerk.<br><br> It's OK, you know, up to about the sixth grade. Nobody really cares, least of all yourself. The teachers are mostly pretty nice to you, because you're easy to teach. Some of them love you for it, and give you neat books for extra reading. Some of them resent it, but they're too busy with the Behavior Problem types to have time to really make you feel lousy for being ahead of the others in math and reading. And there's always a few other kids, usually girls, who are as smart as you are, or smarter, and you and they write the class skits, and make lists for the teacher, and so on. And besides, for all the talk about how cruel little kids are, they haven't got a patch on older people for cruelty. Little kids are just dumb, the smart ones and the slow ones. They do dumb things. They say what they think. They haven't learned enough yet to say what they don't really think. That comes later, when kids begin to turn into people and find out that they are alone.<br><br> I think what you mostly do when you find you really are alone is to panic. You rush to the opposite extreme and pack yourself into groups-clubs, teams, societies, types. You suddenly start dressing exactly like the others. It's a way of being invisible. The way you sew the patches on the holes in your blue jeans becomes incredibly important. If you do it wrong you're not with it. You have to be with it. That's a peculiar phrase, you know? With it. With what? With them. With the others. All together. Safety in numbers. I'm not me. I'm a basketball letter. I'm a popular kid. I'm my friends' friend. I'm a black leather growth on a Honda. I'm a member. I'm a teen-ager. You can't see me, all you can see is us. We're safe.<br><br> And if We see You standing alone by yourself, if you're lucky we'll ignore you. If you're not lucky, we might throw rocks. Because we don't like people standing there with the wrong kind of patches on their blue jeans reminding us that we're each alone and none of us is safe.<br><br> I tried. I really did. I tried so hard it makes me sick to think about it. I did my jeans patches exactly like Bill Ebold who did everything right. I talked about baseball scores. I worked for the school paper for one term, because that was the one group that I could figure out how to get into. But none of it worked. I don't know why. Sometimes I wonder if introverts have a peculiar smell, which only extraverts are aware of.<br><br> Some kids really don't have much Me at all. They truly are part of the group. But a lot of them just act-pretend-the way I tried to. Their heart isn't really in the groups, but still they get along, they get by. I wish I could. I honestly wish I could be a good hypocrite. It doesn't hurt anybody, and it sure makes life easier. But I never could fool anybody. They knew I wasn't interested in what interested them, and they despised me for it, and I despised them for despising me. But then I also despised the few kids who didn't try to go along. In ninth grade there was this tall kid who never brushed his teeth and wore a white sports coat to school, who wanted to make friends with me. I should have been delighted; I mean, nobody had ever wanted to make friends with me before. But he kept saying things like what a drip this person was and what a dolt that one was, and although I agreed with him I didn't want to talk about it all the time, and so I despised him for being a snob. And then I despised myself for despising everybody else. Oh, it's a really neat situation to be in. You know what I mean, if you've been there.<br><br> Since I was trying hard not to be different, I didn't want to be a straight-A type; but that problem was always solved for me by gym. I wasn't any worse at gym than a lot of fellows, but I got D's because I cut it all the time because I couldn't take Mr. Thorpe. "If you can take your minds off Keats and Shelley for a while, Griffiths, you might at least stand around and watch how basketball is played." It was always Keats and Shelley-I heard him use exactly the same line to at least two other fellows. He said it with real hatred, hissing: Keatsssnssshelley, ssssss. It was stupid applied to me, since math and science is where I am good, but that hatred got me so curious I went back and read Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale" in the freshman lit text. They didn't give us any Shelley, but I looked up his collected works at the city library, and later on I bought it secondhand. So it was Mr. Thorpe teaching basketball who put me on to "Prometheus Unbound." I should be grateful. But it still didn't make third period with Mr. Thorpe any easier.<br><br> But- this is important-I never talked back. I never said anything. I could have said, "Look, Mr. Thorpe, I don't want to take my mind off Keats and Shelley, or sines and cosines, so you just go ahead and bounce your little bouncyball, OK?" Some of the kids could do that. Back in elementary school once I heard a little black seventh-grade girl tell off our math teacher, "You just get your hands off my paper, if you don't like it the way I done it, you can just stuff it!" It was pure fight-the teacher hadn't done anything to deserve it, he was just trying to teach the kid some math-but still, it was pure fight, it was courage, and I admired it. I still do. But I can't do it. I haven't got it. I don't get into fights.<br><br> I stand there and take it, till I can run. And then I run.<br><br> Sometimes I not only stand there and take it, I even smile at them and say I'm sorry.<br><br> When I feel that smile coming onto my face, I wish I could take my face off and stamp on it.<br><br>Copyright � 1976 by Ursula K.

At a low point in his lowly career, Victor finds himself skulking through the streets of Philadelphia carrying a bag full of money for an ambitious politician. It is a rotten job on the wrong side of anyone&#x2019;s line, but with bag in hand Victor is suddenly hobnobbing with the city&#x2019;s elite, filling his bank account, and having sex with the politician&#x2019;s gorgeous and deranged sister. But just when Victor begins to think he&#x2019;s got a future in the political game, one of his payoffs ends up in the pocket of a dead woman, and Victor goes from bagman to fall guy. Now Victor&#x2019;s only way out might lie with a brotherhood of shady characters with sacks full of cash, bad fedoras, and their own twisted set of rules. Will Victor&#x2019;s new friends help him find a killer or bury him deep?</p></p><p><p>William Lashner is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Barkeep</i>, <i>The Accounting</i>, <i>Blood and Bone</i>, and eight previous Victor Carl novels, which have been translated into more than a dozen languages and sold across the globe. Writing under the pseudonym Tyler Knox, Lashner is also the author of <i>Kockroach</i>, a <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice, which was described as &#x201c;roaringly entertaining&#x201d; by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> and &#x201c;an energetic tour de force&#x201d; by <i>USA Today</i>. Before retiring from law to write full-time, Lashner was a prosecutor with the Department of Justice in Washington DC. He is a graduate of the New York University School of Law as well as the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop. He lives with his wife, his three children, and his dog, Chase Muttley, outside of Philadelphia.</p><p>Sometimes trolling for clients at the courthouse won&#x2019;t do it, so lawyer Victor Carl goes even lower. He becomes a bagman, toting cash from one who needs a favor to one who can grant it. No sooner have we finished the second chapter than a corpse is found with clues that lead to Carl. Detective work intersects bag work for the rest of the novel, and the author is good at both. This is one of the rare crime novels that convey a little-known truth: moving through glittering rooms full of wealthy, beautiful people with shark edges can be really tiresome. More death leads Carl to a Chinatown-like revelation, though readers might find the most fun is in the buildup. Carl turns conversations into vaudeville routines, with the world his straight man, and though there are too many of them, the exchanges are often very funny. Cop: "God is dead." Lawyer: "That means there&#x2019;s an opening.&#x201d; And there&#x2019;s room for philosophy, too. Bagmen aren&#x2019;t always awful. They grease wheels, unjam jams.

They&#x2019;re just classic &#x201c;domestic&#x201d; novels about marriage, motherhood, and modern upper-middle-class family life, after all. And despite the fact that <em>Big Little Lies</em> is Moriarty&#x2019;s sixth adult novel (and it comes decades after the grandmother of this kind of thing, <em>Bridget Jones&#x2019; Diary</em>), it is remarkably new and fresh and winning Set in an Australian suburb, <em>Big Little Lies</em> focuses on three women, all of whom have children at the same preschool. One is a great beauty married to a fabulously rich businessman; they have a &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; set of twins. One is the can-do mom who can put together a mean pre-school art project but can&#x2019;t prevent her teenage daughter from preferring her divorced dad. The third is a withdrawn, single mother who doesn&#x2019;t quite fit in. Right from the start--thanks to a modern &#x201c;Greek chorus&#x201d; that narrates the action--we know that someone is going to end up dead. The questions are who and how. Miraculously, Moriarty keeps this high concept plot aloft, largely because she infuses it with such wit and heart. She also knows not to overplay the message she&#x2019;s sending: that we all tell lies--to each other and, more importantly, to ourselves. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Liane Moriarty</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Truly Madly Guilty</i>, <i>Big Little Lies</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Husband&#x2019;s Secret</i>, <i>The Hypnotist&#x2019;s Love Story</i>, and <i>What Alice Forgot</i>.

As cries for independence ring through the chambers of the Second Continental Congress, Captain Isaac Biddlecomb and his crew are called upon to engage The Royal Navy.</p><p>James L.

Find out more at JamesLNelson.com.At the outset, the final installment in Nelson's Revolution at Sea trilogy (after The Maddest Idea) seems to chart a steady course through the standard formulaic historical romance, with dashing swashbucklers, satin-skinned ingenues, crusty old sea dogs and a heinous villain belowdecks. Once on the open seas, however, Nelson proves again to be an able novelist who handles deftly the conventions of the O'Brien-dominated maritime genre and writes characters who burst out of their stereotypes. Isaac Biddlecomb, now captain of the converted merchantman Charlemagne, a newly commissioned brig-of-war in the Continental Navy of 1776, is being pursued by his archenemy, HMS Glasgow. Through a series of clever yachting maneuvers, Biddlecomb eludes the larger enemy ship, impresses the love of his life, Virginia Stanton, daughter of his old mentor, and makes himself a hero. After a brief and somewhat tedious stay on shore, though, during which the reader is treated to cameos of Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin and other founding fathers, the captain and his ship join the fledgling Continental fleet and the salt breeze invigorates Nelson's tale as his hero sails through various adventures in the Bahamas. Nelson's capacious knowledge of sailing and period maritime practices informs the book on every page and very nearly clutters the story with too much seamanship. But his rounded characters, tense action and battle sequences will certainly please fans of historical fiction.

It is found in our relationships with ourselves, with our world, with others, and with our Creator. This is the dancing that can come out of mourning: the hope of restored relationships. Mourning into Dancing defines the stages of grief, names the many kinds of loss we suffer, shows how to help the grief-stricken, gives a new vision of Christ&#39;s sacrifice, and shows how a loving God shares our grief. We learn from this book that the way to dancing is through the valley of mourning--that grief is a poignant reminder of the fullness of life Christ obtained for us through his resurrection. In the words of writer and critic John Timmerman, Mourning into Dancing &#34;could well be the most important book you ever read.&#34;</p><h2>The Devastating Boys (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>The protagonists of these eleven short tales find themselves stripped of private illusions as they confront unusual situations</p><p>Elizabeth Taylor was born in Reading in 1912.

Once upon a time, when a young girl asked a librarian for a princess book, she meant a traditional fairy tale featuring a princess. Now, as likely as not, she wants a book from Levine's series the Princess Tales, small volumes that borrow elements from folk-tales to create lively, new stories. In <i>Fairy's Return</i>, a princess falls in love with the third son of a baker, a young man whose jokes make her laugh. With both parents resisting the marriage, it takes determination, imagination, and the intervention of a wish-granting fairy to bring this couple to the point of "happily ever after." <i>For Biddle's Sake</i> introduces Parsley, a sweet-natured girl raised by the fairy Bombina, who struggles with an obsessive drive to turn people into toads. After many years of relative control, she flies into a fit of rage and transforms her beloved Parsley. Only a marriage proposal from a human can return Parsley to her previous form.

EISNER has worked in the entertainment industry for over forty years, the last twenty-one as chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company. He and his wife, Jane, live in Los Angeles. All of his proceeds from this book have been donated to The Eisner Foundation, which is providing scholarships to send underserved children to the camp.Both of these heavily illustrated books look at two less celebrated sections of the Disney empire, and the rare artwork that both contain is their strongest asset. Canemaker's book is on the people who created preliminary sketches "that explore the visual possibilities in a literary property." These possibilities for any proposed cartoon include the visual style of the film, how the characters will look, the way a major scene could be portrayed, and so on. Specific sketch artists have put their individual stamp on the entire look of the finished film in such cases as Sleeping Beauty, Bambi, and Night on Bald Mountain. In addition, they have created memorable minor characters, such as Pocahontas's raccoon pal and Beauty and the Beast's Mrs. Potts. Canemaker primarily concentrates on the feature-length cartoons, and he gives special attention to Fantasia. By chronologically examining the life and work of the significant sketch artists, he ably demonstrates their contributions. An interesting look at a neglected aspect of the Disney films. With a combination of imagination and engineering skill, the Imagineers create all elements of the Disney theme parks, from the rides, attractions, shops, and restaurants to the signs, light fixtures, trash cans, and landscaping. Starting with Disneyland and continuing up to the present day, this book attempts to show how "imagineering" created so many memorable experiences. Even with the aid of copious illustrations?never-before-seen artwork from the Imagineering Division's own files?the act of imaginative creation is difficult to re-create, and this work doesn't completely succeed in showing how the Imagineers brought their creations into being. It is further hampered by a once-over-lightly writing style. But that is a minor quibble in what for the most part is a fascinating before-the-curtain-rises look at the Disney theme parks.

Vidor, planning to make a movie about William Desmond Taylor, murdered in 1922, set out to investigate the unsolved crime 45 years later. Taylor had been a famous director of silents and his death was a sensation that ruined the careers of actresses Mary Miles Minter, Mabel Normand (the victim's reputed lovers) and other Hollywood luminaries. Kirkpatrick skillfully leads the reader into Vidor's search as the director studies old files and questions people in the movie colony who remembered those involved in the tragedy. The result is a riveting mystery. In his dramatic reconstruction, Kirkpatrick uncovers Vidor's convincing evidence, never disclosed by the director, that Taylor was killed by the mother of ingenue Minter.

In 1967, the late director King Vidor decided to investigate the mystery in order to make a film about it. (No film resulted.) Kirkpatrick recounts the story of Vidor's sleuthing, which uncovered scandal, corruption, coverups, and, ultimately, Vidor believed, the identity of the killer.

The disc contains footage of President Forrester's assassination, the same video that has been broadcast countless times on TV and over the internet-with one crucial, shocking difference: This version shows that before the video was released, it was altered with sinister special effects.<br><br>This explosive discovery will lead Gideon Wolfe on an electrifying journey from a criminal underworld of New York to the jungles of Africa and on a quest to find the truth in an age when all information can be manipulated. With this novel, Carr has boldly established a new genre-future history-combining the best elements of mystery and thrillers with unique historical insight. Breathtakingly suspenseful,<b>Killing Time</b> unfolds as the work of a master novelist.</p><p>It's 2023, and the Web has almost destroyed the world. While cyberspace's early pioneers promoted the Net as a revolution in human communication, America has instead become a society of desk-bound introverts who believe everything they read. The federal government has been "bought" by a Microsoft-style corporation. Any semblance of central authority has vanished. As the Net infiltrates India and Pakistan, fevered nationalists and terrorists find one more medium through which to spread the word.<p> With <i>Killing Time</i>, Caleb Carr (<i>The Alienist</i>, <i>The Angel of Darkness</i>) manages to create a future that's both frightening and nostalgic. The novel's narrator, Dr. Gideon Wolfe, longs for a world before technology swallowed people's minds and imaginations. Through a series of complex misadventures, beginning with the murder of his best friend, Gideon finds himself joining a ragtag army of scientists and inventors who hope to take it back. Heading up this '60s-style revolutionary cell is a brother-sister team--genetically engineered geniuses with silver hair and shining eyes. Aboard their ultramodern ship, Gideon learns the extent of the damage done. When they dive below the surface of the Atlantic, he looks out the window and sees </p><blockquote> not an idyllic scene of aquatic wonder such as childhood stories might have led me to expect but rather a horrifying expanse of brown water filled with human and animal waste, all of it endlessly roiled but never cleansed by the steady pulse of the offshore currents. </blockquote> Carr's future is suffused with regret. It's also rife with mystery and suspense; in every chapter the stakes are raised a little higher, the apocalypse hovers a little closer. This author is a master of the cliffhanger, of cryptic warnings that return to haunt our hero later in the text. Occasional flashes of humor relieve the prevailing ominousness, and a beautiful girl with a huge gun appears at regular intervals to keep things humming. Fans of Steve Erickson's end-of-the-world novels will likely enjoy this adventure in the Internet age, where the sheer amount of information has induced not quantitative changes in the human psyche, but qualitative ones. <i>--Ellen Williams</i><b>CALEB CARR</b> was born in Manhattan and grew up on the Lower East Side, where he still lives.

Wladziu Valentino ("Lee") Liberace was considered a future concert pianist in his hometown, Milwaukee, Wisc., but he became Mr. Show Business by mixing classics with tunes from Tin Pan Alley, which endeared him to fans. He learned the value of publicity in his youth and cultivated attention by wearing extravagant costumes that drew crowds to his live shows and TV appearances. Also part of the act, according to Thomas, was the "sincere wink" lavished on older women who were Liberace's greatest admirers. The author is sympathetic to this victim of AIDS, without omitting to note that the performer denied under oath his homosexuality when he sued a British and an American journalist for libel. Thomas also reports on the unsuccessful attempt to cover up the true cause of the entertainer's illness that brought on his death in 1986 at age 67.

Readers will learn about the decisions that radically affected the course of Christian history and that still shape Christianity today. Here, ten top theologians, all practising Christians, tackle ten ancient heresies and show why the contemporary Church still needs to know about them. Christians need to remember what these great early heresies were and why they were ruled out, or else risk falling prey to their modern-day manifestations. The contributors show how present debates in the Church are often re-enactments of battles which the Church thought it had won against heresies many centuries ago. <br> The book contains key scriptural passages relevant to each heresy, a glossary of terms, and summaries of historical Church documents in which these heresies were defined and outlawed.&nbsp; <br> <b>Contributors include</b><br>The Revd Dr Ben Quash, Professor of Christianity and the Arts, King's College, London&nbsp;<br>Dr Janet Martin Soskice, Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge&nbsp;The Revd Dr Michael B.

It is, in short, a lie that steals real peace and hides true joy. Now Alan D.

While he experienced this liberation for himself, as a pastor he has also guided countless others to the same place of freedom.

The arrival of Alan Field, a devastatingly handsome though shady figure from Carmona&#39;s past, destroys the holiday atmosphere in the old house and replaces it with a mounting tension, culminating in murder. Fortunately, Miss Silver is present to unravel the complex mystery and seek out the murderer amongst them.</p><p>Patricia Wentworth (1878 1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.<br></p><h2>The Language Book (Poetics of the New)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Ok murky in alter all end, unpredictable day, with rainshine any degree night, the sun kin warm and hot.

While his father labored for the next decade to revitalize the sprawling sea island plantation&#39;s dairy operation, Clyde reveled in a world utterly foreign from the community of his birth; he encountered a society of mannered gentility, a climate in which winter passed in a twinkling of an eye, a place of wandering tidal streams and vast expanses of salt marshes, and a people - African-American people - he had never met. In Sea Island Yankee, Bresee revisits the time and place that endowed his childhood with great happiness and have held a powerful grip on his adult musings. With the observant eyes of a youngster and the distanced perspective of an outsider, Bresee re-creates his boyhood world of water, live oaks, and Spanish moss. He recalls Confederate memorial observances at which he heard white-haired veterans recount Civil War battles, and he chronicles seemingly endless opportunities for swimming, crabbing, boating, and exploring. Bresee also pays tribute to the unforgettable African Americans who shaped his sea island experience, from Jamsie, his multi-talented playmate, to Ned, the indispensable plantation employee who once saved the life of Clyde&#39;s brother. Enhanced by charming illustrations, Bresee&#39;s beautifully crafted account captures the adventures of a wondrous boyhood and the character of a remarkable sea island community.Bresee came to the Charleston, South Carolina sea islands in 1921 with his family at the age of six and returned to the Pennsylvania mountains to the family farm during the early years of the Depression. Sea Island Yankee is his recollection of his formative years on St. James Islandyears marked by personal growth and increasing awareness of his small world. Often humorous and even bittersweet, the book is a poignant reflection of Southern customs, family life, school, and race relations. Especially touching is Bresee's account of his return to St. James many years later and a meeting with a black friend of his youth. This is the first in a new series. Other planned titles will focus on Dallas; Dedham, Massachusetts; and Oxford, Georgia. A worthwhile addition for public and academic libraries. Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ.

Armentrout lives in Martinsburg, West Virginia. All the rumors you&#39;ve heard about her state aren&#39;t true. When she&#39;s not hard at work writing. she spends her time reading, working out, watching really bad zombie movies, pretending to write, and hanging out with her husband and her Jack Russell, Loki.Armentrout (the Covenant series) immerses readers in the wildly altered world of 17-year-old Samantha who, upon awakening in a hospital with dehydration, a concussion, and extreme shock, remembers nothing about her life. She is told that she was found in the state forest after being missing for four days and that her best friend Cassie is still missing. Quickly learning that she was both popular and despised at school, Samantha is sickened by her so-called friends and boyfriend, as well as disturbed by the tension between her parents; she attempts to make amends with those she has betrayed and develops a crush on someone she never gave the time of day to before. When Samantha begins to receive notes that urge her to distance herself from her past, she's determined to do the opposite and find out what happened to Cassie while unlocking her memories. Armentrout's taut mystery, chilling images, and smooth writing deliver ample suspense, however, the real impact of the story lies in witnessing an individual's rare chance to rediscover and reshape her identity. Ages 14 up.<p></p>--<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>Gr 7-10 From the very first page, readers are thrust into the mind of confused amnesiac Samantha, who finds herself at the center of the mysterious disappearance of her best friend, Cassie. The protagonist was the last person known to see Cassie alive; the problem is that the teen remembers nothing of their last night together and, for that matter, nothing of her life at all. With the help of her brother and the compelling and handsome Carson Ortiz, Samantha figures out that the old Sam, the one she can't remember, might be one that's worth forgetting. Popular, powerful, and mean, she and her best frenemy Cassie had ruled the school and put down anyone in their path. In the search for someone who would have wanted to cause the two of them harm, she realizes that the list could be a long one. Someone clearly knows things no one else could about that night and leaves threatening notes telling the narrator to stop searching for the truth. Readers are led to wonder if Samantha's gnawing suspicion that she might be the culprit herself is right or perhaps if her developing romance with Carson is really a romance with Cassie's killer. The action-filled plot and the shocking revelation of the murderer's true identity will leave fans of suspense and mystery thoroughly satisfied. Joanna Sondheim, Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, New York City<p></p> <p></p>--<b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><br><br>Samantha has been missing for days. When she reappears, her entire life seems new, leaving her with many more questions than answers. Her parents, friends, and boyfriend all expect the old Sammy, but the new Sammy is nowhere near the same person. Sammy learns the horrible truth about herself: she used to use her popularity and wealth to control and manipulate everyone. To make matters worse, Cassie, Sammy's best friend, went missing the same day as Sammy, and she is still missing. Most will not admit it, but Sammy feels their stares and is able to read between the lines: they blame her for Cassie's disappearance. Armentrout leaves the reader with many questions: Will Sammy ever recover her memories? Who is to blame for Cassie's disappearance? Did Sammy hurt her friend? <p></p> The first-person narrative gives a glimpse into the intense frustration that goes along with memory loss. Sammy shares each of her personal struggles with the reader. After every question and with each clue she finds, the reader partners with Sammy to piece together her discombobulated life. Anyone who picks up this book will develop a close relationship with Sammy, leaving the reader fully invested in the character and the mystery. Sprinkled throughout the story, profanity and flirtation make the dialogue and relationships more realistic. Armentrout tastefully develops love scenes, which may cause the reader to fail to realize the extent of what just occurred. With an unexpected and a little over-the-top resolution, Don't Look Back will keep the reader guessing until the very last page.-Richard Vigdor.<p></p>--<b><i>VOYA</i></b></p><h2>Sewing Vintage Aprons: Classic Aprons for Today&#39;s Lifestyle</h2><p>For decades, smart stylish women have worn different aprons to suit their various needs.

I remember my mother wearing them when I was a&nbsp;little girl and the excitement I felt when she tied one on me to help her cook.

As I worked on the aprons&nbsp;for this book, Ryan would said, "I wanna wear it." This puts a&nbsp;big smile on grandma's face.&nbsp;<br><br>My grandmother Evelyn wore an apron all the time. She called it her housecoat.&nbsp;It was so used, that it wore thin, and you could see her blouse underneath. Her housecoat was more of the "cobbler" style, with armholes and snaps or buttons to close the front and two big pockets on either side. I can see it now--such a sweet memory.<br>My grandmother Sadie wore half aprons most of the time, and&nbsp;sometimes wore a full apron to protect her clothes from cooking. She loved to cook and grew a garden. Her homemade apron became part of her arms and hands as it carried produce from the garden into the house.

But it&#x2019;s a bit less widely understood that in about 1950, this stream of great songs more or less dried up. All of a sudden, what came over the radio wasn&#x2019;t Gershwin, Porter, and Berlin, but &#x201c;Come on-a My House&#x201d; and &#x201c;How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?&#x201d; Elvis and rock and roll arrived a few years later, and at that point the game was truly up. What happened, and why? In <i>The B Side</i>, acclaimed cultural historian Ben Yagoda answers those questions in a fascinating piece of detective work. Drawing on previously untapped archival sources and on scores of interviews&#x2014;the voices include Randy Newman, Jimmy Webb, Linda Ronstadt, and Herb Alpert&#x2014;the book illuminates broad musical trends through a series of intertwined stories. Among them are the battle between ASCAP and Broadcast Music, Inc.; the revolution in jazz after World War II; the impact of radio and then television; and the bitter, decades-long feud between Mitch Miller and Frank Sinatra.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The B Side</i> is about taste, and the particular economics and culture of songwriting, and the potential of popular art for greatness and beauty. It&#x2019;s destined to become a classic of American musical history.</p><p><b>Ben Yagoda</b> is a journalism professor at the University of Delaware.

Jarrett had just released an album called <i>Somewhere</i>, which included his trio&#x2019;s rendition of the songs &#x201c;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&#x201d; (written in 1932), &#x201c;Stars Fell on Alabama&#x201d; (1934), and &#x201c;I Thought About You&#x201d; (1939). Jarrett has a reputation as an avant-garde jazz artist, but this was only the latest of a series of albums&#x2014;others include <i>Standards, Vol. 1</i>; <i>Standards, Vol. 2</i>; and <i>Setting Standards&#x2014;</i>that featured his trio&#x2019;s renditions of classic American popular songs written roughly in the second quarter of the twentieth century. That is, standards.</p><p>Siegel started off by saying, &#x201c;Standard tunes, first of all, what do they mean to you and why have you recorded so many of them on this disc?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First of all, they are anything but standard by today&#x2019;s standards,&#x201d; Jarrett replied. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re exceptional. There was a period of time in American history where so many things came rushing in, especially in popular music.&#x201d;</p><p>Siegel wondered, &#x201c;Do we not have more songs like this for lack of people trying to write them? Is it unfashionable?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, is the short answer to that,&#x201d; Jarrett said. He suggested parts of a longer answer as well. First, in that long-ago period of time, there were &#x201c;people who were actually good at writing melodies.&#x201d; Second, he talked about the importance of singers. He recounted that Miles Davis was once asked who he learned his phrasing from. His answer: Frank Sinatra. Today, Jarrett said, &#x201c;there are also no important singers, so maybe it&#x2019;s all part of the same pancake mix. If there&#x2019;s no singers and there&#x2019;s no good songs, which came first?&#x201d;</p><p>The pianist said it once occurred to him to try to write a standard, a song that had the quality of having &#x201c;existed before.&#x201d; He eventually came up with a tune he called &#x201c;No Lonely Nights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t that easy to do,&#x201d; Jarrett said.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The standards, as Jarrett said, &#x201c;came rushing in&#x201d;&#x2014;from the 1920s through the 1950s, but most quickly and intensely in a two-decade span starting in about 1925. The best of them are said to make up the &#x201c;Great American Songbook&#x201d; (the term was first used as the title of a 1972 album by the jazz singer Carmen McRae), the size of which varies depending on who&#x2019;s counting. In his definitive book <i>American Popular Song</i>, Alec Wilder puts forth about three hundred entries.</p><p>What are the attributes of these few hundred songs? The composer Jule Styne once gave a concise definition to a young friend of his, the jazz pianist Bill Charlap: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the secret to a great popular song? It must be melodically simple and harmonically attractive.&#x201d; Expanding on that, standard songs are sophisticated (in several senses of the word) and melodic, constructed with, at the minimum, superior craftsmanship, and sometimes with remarkable innovation and artistry. Charlap is speaking of Styne&#x2019;s &#x201c;Just in Time,&#x201d; but he could be referring to any of hundreds of songs: &#x201c;It has an innate sense of structure. There are rests, points of emphasis, and overall balance and taste. It&#x2019;s so pliable, and very American.&#x201d; Although the standards are roughly divided into ballads (slow) and rhythm tunes (fast), the categories are fungible and a given tune can be interpreted in many different ways. Fast or slow, standards are jazz-inflected in rhythm and harmonic possibilities and, especially in later years, show the influence of modern European composers like Ravel and Debussy. The main criterion for songs&#x2019; status as standard is the music, but most of them have lyrics that rise to the occasion and are wedded to the melody: sophisticated, once again, and sometimes dazzlingly inventive. The internal rhymes and wordplay from a Cole Porter or Lorenz Hart can suggest W. S. Gilbert with an American accent. But even when dealing with commonplace tropes of love and longing, as in Irving Berlin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Always,&#x201d; &#x201c;How Deep Is the Ocean,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep),&#x201d; a standard can have a palpable honesty and conviction and can be emotionally affecting without being schmaltzy. Or at least it can be delivered that way by the right singer.</p><p>The melodies were written&#x2014;to start naming the great names&#x2014;by Berlin, by George Gershwin, by Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Duke Ellington, Arthur Schwartz, Harry Warren, Hoagy Carmichael, Richard Whiting, Vincent Youmans, Walter Donaldson, and Jimmy McHugh. They went with lyrics by Ira Gershwin (George&#x2019;s brother), Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein II, Howard Dietz, and E. Y. &#x201c;Yip&#x201d; Harburg. Those men were all born within a seventeen-year span, from Kern in 1885 to Rodgers in 1902. A slightly younger group, consisting of Harold Arlen, Vernon Duke, Dorothy Fields, Frank Loesser, Johnny Mercer, Jule Styne, and Fats Waller, were born between 1903 and 1910. Burton Lane and Jimmy Van Heusen came on the scene in 1912 and 1913, respectively, and that was pretty much that. To be sure, not all their songs were gems, and even in the very heart of the golden age, a lot of hack tunesmiths turned out reams of lesser material. But not every painter in Renaissance Florence was a Leonardo or a Botticelli. The comparison might raise your eyebrow, or both of them. But the more you ponder the short list of places where intense creativity emerged from a core group of artists in a limited amount of time, the less far-fetched it begins to seem.</p><p>The place from which the Great American Songbook emerged was New York City. The highly concentrated music industry originated around the turn of the twentieth century on one Manhattan block, West Twenty-eighth Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue, called &#x201c;Tin Pan Alley&#x201d; for the cacophony that blew out of music publishers&#x2019; offices. The designation persisted even after the publishers moved uptown, to various outposts centered around the Brill Building on Broadway at Forty-ninth Street. From the 1920s on, a growing number of the best songs originated in the scores of New York musical shows or revues. Henceforth, an ambitious fledgling songwriter&#x2019;s goal was to have his number in the Broadway spotlight, figuratively and literally&#x2014;clearly, a big step up from being a mere assembly-line worker in the pop music factory.</p><p>The first talking motion picture, in 1927, was a musical called <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, and for two decades after that, Hollywood was the western outpost of American songwriting, the home base for such outstanding practitioners as Warren, Mercer, Arlen, and Van Heusen, as well as lesser artisans. Bigfoot New Yorkers periodically went west for short sojourns. Some of the biggest furnished just three 1930s films starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers with an astonishing number of standards of the highest caliber: Irving Berlin&#x2019;s score for <i>Top Hat</i> (&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t This a Lovely Day [to Be Caught in the Rain]?,&#x201d; &#x201c;Cheek to Cheek,&#x201d; &#x201c;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&#x201d;); Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields&#x2019;s for <i>Swing Time</i> (&#x201c;The Way You Look Tonight,&#x201d; &#x201c;A Fine Romance,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pick Yourself Up&#x201d;); and the Gershwin brothers&#x2019; for <i>Shall We Dance</i> (&#x201c;They All Laughed,&#x201d; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Call the Whole Thing Off,&#x201d; &#x201c;They Can&#x2019;t Take That Away from Me&#x201d;). But gems popped up even in films that were less than classics. I&#x2019;ll cite three examples from hundreds. Kern and Oscar Hammerstein&#x2019;s timeless &#x201c;The Folks Who Live on the Hill&#x201d; was introduced by Irene Dunne in a forgotten 1937 film, <i>High, Wide and Handsome</i>. &#x201c;There Will Never Be Another You,&#x201d; with music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Mack Gordon, is recognized as one of the greatest songs ever; go to a jazz gig in any city in the world, and you are likely to find it on the setlist. It first appeared in a 1942 Twentieth Century&#x2013;Fox B movie called <i>Iceland</i>, starring skater Sonja Henie and John Payne as a U.S. Marine posted in&#x2014;that&#x2019;s right&#x2014;Iceland. Another from the same year: the timeless &#x201c;Moonlight Becomes You,&#x201d; by Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Heusen, originated as filler in a Bob Hope&#x2013;Bing Crosby comedy, <i>Road to Morocco</i>.</p><p>The parity among the three sources of standards&#x2014;Broadway shows, Hollywood movies, and one-off Tin Pan Alley compositions&#x2014;is illustrated by a recent book of sheet music, <i>The Great American Songbook: The Composers</i>. The Hal Leonard Corporation book includes one hundred songs, from &#x201c;Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive&#x201d; to &#x201c;You&#x2019;d Be So Nice to Come Home To.&#x201d; The roster is highly selective and (obviously) subjective, but it&#x2019;s credible, and useful for giving a sense of where standards originated. Eighty-two songs in the book were written in 1950 or earlier. Of them, 33 percent came from Broadway, 33 percent from Tin Pan Alley, and 34 percent from Hollywood.*</p><p>The songs were composed with sundry goals in mind, producing great art rarely being one of them. But the songs&#x2014;the best of them, anyway&#x2014;took on lives of their own: it turned out they lent themselves to being interpreted in different styles and with different approaches by a range of singers and musicians. They became a repertoire, a canon, repeatedly redefined by distinctive performances, some of which were, in fact, works of art: Coleman Hawkins&#x2019;s &#x201c;Body and Soul,&#x201d; Teddy Wilson and Gerry Mulligan&#x2019;s &#x201c;As Time Goes By,&#x201d; Bunny Berigan&#x2019;s &#x201c;I Can&#x2019;t Get Started,&#x201d; Fred Astaire&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cheek to Cheek,&#x201d; the Boswell Sisters&#x2019; &#x201c;The Object of My Affection,&#x201d; Artie Shaw&#x2019;s &#x201c;Begin the Beguine,&#x201d; Billie Holiday&#x2019;s &#x201c;They Can&#x2019;t Take That Away from Me,&#x201d; and so on. It was more than a matter of individual renditions. The songs provided the foundation of myriad laudable and important American enterprises: not only jazz and the Broadway and Hollywood musical, but popular dancing, the recording industry, radio (or the significant part of it devoted to music), and the crafts of singing, playing instruments, and arranging and conducting music for big bands. Collectively, they constituted one of the great cultural achievements of the United States in the twentieth century.</p><p>The most successful songwriters in the Great American Songbook period were recognized for their achievements, repeatedly interviewed in the popular press, and periodically turned into the subjects of biographical movies. Their names went above the titles on billboards for shows and movies. They garnered fortune as well as fame, through a number of different streams of revenue. The best-known but least common was the long run of a Broadway musical in which their songs appeared. Hollywood work was compensated by a weekly salary or a per-picture contract, so the upside was less spectacular, but the terms were generous and the work steady. The biggest potential financial boon was via United States copyright law and the efforts of a collective organization called the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Composers and lyricists were paid a few pennies each time a recording of a song they&#x2019;d written was played on the radio or bought at a record store. When a song was played and bought a lot&#x2014;when it became a hit, as measured by the charts in the weekly <i>Billboard </i>magazine&#x2014;the pennies added up to a huge payday.*</p><p>In the Music Division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., you can request to see Irving Berlin&#x2019;s ledgers. Berlin published his first song, &#x201c;Marie from Sunny Italy,&#x201d; in 1907, when he was nineteen, and his first big hit, &#x201c;Alexander&#x2019;s Ragtime Band,&#x201d; four years later. Not long after that, he was acknowledged as the king of American songwriters, a designation he retained until his death at 101 in 1989. The ledgers are mammoth books, bound in red, the entries penciled in precisely by what must have been a small army of accountants. Slowly lifting the cover of the 1950 book, you will see royalties from record and sheet music sales broken down by song&#x2014;from &#x201c;White Christmas,&#x201d; which netted Berlin $13,293.95 for the year, down to &#x201c;Marie from Sunny Italy,&#x201d; which earned a total of two cents (from foreign sheet music sales). The total royalties for the year amounted to $78,079.31, which translates to $771,030.67 in 2014 dollars. That figure does not include Berlin&#x2019;s payments from ASCAP, which were about $72,000, or his earnings from the Broadway hits <i>Annie Get Your Gun </i>(which closed in 1949 after a three-year run) and <i>Call Me Madam </i>(which opened in September 1950).</p><p>Berlin&#x2019;s &#x201c;White Christmas&#x201d; mechanical royalties were almost all due to Bing Crosby&#x2019;s Decca recording of the song, originally released in 1942 and hauled out every yuletide. It hit the top spot on the <i>Billboard </i>charts for several years running, but in 1949 (the year reflected in the 1950 royalties) it was pushed aside by another holiday song and peaked at number five. The other song was the creation of a tunesmith named Johnny Marks, who was several rungs on the ladder down from Berlin. He had put to music a humorous poem, &#x201c;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer,&#x201d; written by his brother-in-law; cowboy singer Gene Autry&#x2019;s recording reached number one on December 31, 1949. Despite the fact that, like Berlin and most other songwriters, he was Jewish, Marks would repeatedly return to this particular well, writing &#x201c;Rockin&#x2019; Around the Christmas Tree,&#x201d; &#x201c;A Holly Jolly Christmas,&#x201d; and other holiday songs. But none reached the heights of his first hit. A 1980 <i>People </i>magazine interview with Marks contained some illuminating statistics. To that point, Autry&#x2019;s version of &#x201c;Rudolph&#x201d; had sold more than 12 million copies, and records by some five hundred other performers 130 million more. The magazine didn&#x2019;t say how much money Marks had made from the song in total but did report that, at the time of the interview, it was netting him some $600,000 a year. That suggests his total &#x201c;Rudolph&#x201d; proceeds, by the time of his death five years later, had probably reached eight figures.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I draw these examples from 1949 and 1950 for a reason. In his scholarly book <i>The American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era</i>,<i> </i>Allen Forte, a professor of the theory of music at Yale University, defined that golden era as lasting from 1924 through 1950. In <i>American Popular Song</i>, published in 1972, Alec Wilder covered work only by songwriters who were already established by 1950. When an interviewer asked why he instituted the cutoff date, Wilder said, &#x201c;After that, the amateurs took over.&#x201d; The statement is hyperbolic and a bit unkind, but its core of truth can be seen in the repertoire of singers and jazz musicians who have the luxury of performing the very best songs. From the 1950s through the present day, the concerts and CDs of Tony Bennett&#x2014;the most justly celebrated singer of standards&#x2014;have been dominated by songs written in the second quarter of the twentieth century. In 2014, Bennett released a collaboration with the pop singer Lady Gaga. Thirteen of its fifteen songs were written between 1928 (&#x201c;I Can&#x2019;t Give You Anything but Love&#x201d;) and 1947 (&#x201c;But Beautiful&#x201d; and &#x201c;Nature Boy&#x201d;). The many singers from other genres who have turned to the American Songbook usually follow similar parameters. In 1978, the country singer Willie Nelson released <i>Stardust</i>, which was on the <i>Billboard</i> list of top-ten albums for two consecutive years and was ultimately certified as quadruple platinum, me...</p></p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 9</h2><p>Shampoo&#39;s spurned suitor Mousse wants revenge on Ranma for &#34;stealing&#34; the object of his affection.

This magnificent color volume is the perfect companion for fans of Tim Burton, his film, and filmmaking. Foreword by Tim Burton.</p><p>Frank Thompson has written for<em>American Film</em>magazine,<em>Film Comment</em>,<em>Boston Globe</em>,<em>Houston Chronicle</em>and<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, among other publications. He is the author of<em>Alamo Movies</em>,<em>William A. Wellman</em>, and<em>Between Action and Cut: Five American Directors</em>.This year's holiday animation release from Walt Disney is a real departure for the studio. The first major movie done entirely in three-dimensional stop-action animation, <i>Nightmare before Christmas</i> is the macabre story of Jack Skellington, "the Pumpkin King of Halloween," who is so delighted when he discovers Christmas that he decides to take over the role of Santa Claus. Tim Burton (<i>Batman</i>, <i>Beetlejuice</i>) came up with the idea 10 years ago when he worked as an animator at Disney during a more straitlaced era; since, things have loosened up enough at the studio for Burton to get the green light on his pet project. This volume, timed to coincide with <i>Nightmare</i>'s theatrical release, chronicles the film from its inception through all stages of production, with commentary from Burton and the other creators. It's loaded with artwork ranging from Burton's original sketches through scenes from the finished film. The groundbreaking movie is a commercially and artistically risky venture, but considering the track record of Burton and the success of Disney's recent animated features, it might just become a holiday perennial; if so, libraries would do well to have this print tie-in on hand. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Dark Rising: A Novel (St. Martin&#39;s Paperbacks Novel)</h2><p><b>DARK RISING </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>A CATACLYSMIC EVENT</b><br> When a massive amount of gamma radiation is detected somewhere beneath the desert of Iran, the world is on edge.

Until now.<br><br>Johanna Fiedler, who was the Met&#x2019;s general press representative for fifteen years, draws upon her insider&#x2019;s knowledge and rivetingly reveals for the first time the company&#x2019;s Byzantine inner workings and the personal, social, economic, and artistic struggles that have always characterized the Met.<br><br><i>Molto Agitato</i> is a tale with an appropriately operatic cast of characters_haughty blue bloods, ambitious social climbers, determined administrators, stubborn board members, temperamental artists_all maneuvering to use their power and influence to make the Met conform to their own agendas. Fiedler brings to life the early days of the Met, with the imperious Toscanini arriving from Italy and Caruso filling the house; the post-WW II years, when the unions gained strength and plagued the company with strikes; and the ever present passions of tenors and sopranos, clashing offstage as well as on. But most revelatory are Fiedler&#x2019;s portrayals of James Levine and Joseph Volpe and their practically parallel ascendancies_Levine rising from prodigy to artistic director, Volpe advancing from stagehand to general manager_and their once strained relationship that was compounded by Volpe&#x2019;s much publicized firing of the soprano Kathleen Battle.<br><br>With its swift-flowing narrative, <i>Molto Agitato </i>is a wonderfully entertaining and thoroughly engaging account not only of one of the world&#x2019;s most respected and richest music institutions but also of power, politics, ambition, and egos.</p><p>&#x201c;Weav[es] telling vignettes and interseting interpretations into a rich tapestry that vividly describes what goes on behind the great gold curtain.

Then along came the hybrid tea roses, which were easier to arrange, more dramatic, and longer-blooming, and the old roses were all but forgotten. Now the lovely, subtle-hued, richly perfumed old roses are making a comeback, thanks to the efforts of a stubborn band of eccentric characters who rescued them from back alleys, ramshackle cottages, and overgrown graveyards across the country. Thomas Christopher tells us the fascinating stories of the old roses&#x2014;how they were created and made their way to America&#x2014;and the unforgettable people who "rustle" them from abandoned lots and secret gardens today, revelling in the mystery of an "unknown yellow."Thomas Christopher is a frequent contributor to Horticulture magazine and the New York Times. He is the author or coauthor of a number of books, most recently East Roses for North American Gardens and Annuals with Style: Design Ideas from Classic to Cutting Edge.

The excitement and impact of these musical forms are the focus of this extensively revised and updated third edition of <i>Folk and Blues: The Encyclopedia. </i>It covers a spectrum of artists, from the pioneers at the turn of the twentieth century to the stars of today: Keb' Mo', Altan the Chieftains, Ani DiFranco, Ry Cooder, Sarah McLachlan, Wilco, John Prine, and Los Lobos, to name a few. <i>Folk and Blues: the Encyclopedia </i>contains:<br><br>-Interviews with many of today's top artists<br>-Extensive awards information from the Grammys, the Folk Alliance, and the Blues Foundation<br>-Photos of the most important folk and blues artists of the twentieth century<br>-The first comprehensive index of folk and blues music<br><br>Unlike any other book currently on the market, <i>Folk and Blues: The Encyclopedia </i>covers the rich roots of American music, as pioneered by African Americans and European immigrants, and its influence on almost every facet of today's popular music around the globe. This encyclopedia provides insight into why folk and blues are distinct fields of their own but interact in many ways to provide important additions to America's musical heritage. This is a unique and highly readable reference that belongs on the desks of music critics and music lovers everywhere.<br></p><p>Irwin Stambler has been writing about music since the mid-1960s. <i>Folk and Blues: The Encyclopedia </i>is his fifth volume in the series for St. Martin's Press, which has also included the <i>Encyclopedia of Pop Music, Encyclopedia of Folk, Country, and Western Music, Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul, and Country Music: The Encyclopedia. </i>Irwin lives in Beverly Hills, California, with his wife, Connie, a talented artist who has contributed sketches to some of his books. His son, Lyndon Stambler, has worked as a writer and journalist for <i>The New York Times </i>and <i>The Los Angeles Times </i>and was a contributor to <i>Country Music: The Encyclopedia </i>and <i>The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul. </i>Since 1990, Lyndon has been a staff correspondent for <i>People Weekly</i>'s Los Angeles Bureau, where his work has included interviews in the music field and album reviews. He now lives in Culver City, California, with his wife, Terry Silberman, who works with South Los Angeles Health Projects.<br>Following two previous Irwin Stambler solo works (The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul and Country Music: The Encyclopedia), this well-done effort will serve as a more than adequate resource for fans and researchers of American folk and blues music. It will be most useful to those looking for an initial in on a particular artist or group or to satisfy a ready-reference need for an all-encompassing encyclopedic-type entry. The entries of many, if not most, of those profiled actually amount to mini-bios, some based on interviews with the performers, others written in cooperation with other experts. The Stamblers give solid coverage to most mainline folk and blues artists, old and new, as well as artists less associated with these genres, such as Dave Alvin and Hoyt Axton. Questions can be raised about criteria, particularly when one finds no entry for Johnny Cash (country and folk, most certainly) but one for Hootie and the Blowfish (rock or pop). Nevertheless, the writing is excellent and informative throughout, making this book a joy just to leaf through or to use for serious research. Some inclusion concerns aside, this is a good purchase where interest warrants."David M. Turkalo, Suffolk Univ. Law Sch.

Creasy's <i>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</i> has been read and re-read for close to 150 years. It is not only the authoritative account of each battle that makes Creasy's work such a classic--it is his command of narrative, his interest in human struggle, his profound deductions as to effects of the battles, and his striving after truth. Furthermore, his selections seem as wise and well-considered today as when <i>Fifteen Decisive Battles</i> first appeared in 1851: Nobody since has made better ones, nor given us better accounts. <br><br>Apart from the scholarship and literary skill of Creasy's book, there is another reason it has endured: Creasy was essentially fair-minded. He had been a judge, and when he became England's great military critic and historian, he maintained a thoroughly judicial attitude. He was not a British partisan, nor French, nor German--he was a cosmopolitan observer of great events.<br>Out of 2300 years, Creasy only found fifteen battles which he called decisive in the highest sense. He chose them not for the number of killed and wounded, nor for their status in myth and lore, but because they fundamentally changed the course of world history. In doing so, he made his book a miniature military history of the western world, a classic that will repay continued study for generations to come, as it has for generations.</p><p><b>Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy </b>(1812-1878) was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and worked as a lawyer and judge until 1840, when he became a professor of history at the University of London. In 1860 he became Chief Justice of Ceylon. After his return to England in 1870, he wrote and published several books, though none received the acclaim of <i>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World.</i></p><h2>A Princess of Mars</h2><p>Let the adventures begin, as Captain John Carter finds himself transported to the alien landscape of Mars--where the low gravity increases his speed and strength exponentially. Taken prisoner by Martian warriors, he impresses them with his remarkable fighting skills, and quickly rises to a high-ranking chieftain. But the heroic Carter's powers thrust him right in the middle of a deadly war raging across the planet--and a dangerous romance with a divine princess.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Although Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) is justifiably famous as the creator of <i>Tarzan of the Apes</i>, that uprooted Englishman was not his only popular hero. Burroughs's first sale (in 1912) was <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, opening the floodgates to one of the must successful--and prolific--literary careers in history. This is a wonderful scientific romance that perhaps can be best described as early science fiction melded with an epic dose of romantic adventure. <i>A Princess of Mars</i> is the first adventure of John Carter, a Civil War veteran who unexpectedly find himself transplanted to the planet Mars. Yet this red planet is far more than a dusty, barren place; it's a fantasy world populated with giant green barbarians, beautiful maidens in distress, and weird flora and monstrous fauna the likes of which could only exist in the author's boundless imagination. Sheer escapism of the tallest order, the Martian novels are perfect entertainment for those who find Tarzan's fantastic adventures aren't, well, fantastic enough. Although this novel can stand alone, there are a total of 11 volumes in this classic series of otherworldly, swashbuckling adventure. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and library bound.

Appointed Director General of MI5 in 1992, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first Director General whose name was publicly announced on appointment.

Rimington lives in London.1 November For once Alvin Jackson had made the wrong choice.Usually he had an unerring eye for a soft target. It wasn't about size-once a man built like a nightclub bouncer had cried when Jackson showed him the knife. No, it was something less tangible, a kind of passivity that Jackson could sniff out, the way a sniffer dog smells contraband.Not that he expected much resistance from anyone in this part of London. He stood against the iron railings in one of the squares that run off the side streets below Kensington High Street. The night was moonless, and a mass of grey cloud hung over the city like a dirty blanket. Earlier in the evening it had rained: now the tyres of passing cars hissed as they splashed through the puddles, and the pavements were the colour of dark sodden sponges. Jackson had picked a corner where two of the street lights were out. He'd already checked carefully for patrolling policemen and traffic wardens. There weren't any.The woman walking towards Jackson along the opposite pavement was well into her thirties-not young enough to be foolish and too affluent to be streetwise. She wore a smartly cut black overcoat, her hair was coiffed back, doubtless from a fancy salon, and her heels went <i>clack-clack-clack</i> on the pavement. There was a bag hooked over her right shoulder, one of those trendy leather bags with floppy handles. That's where her purse would be, Jackson decided.He waited against the railings until she was about fifteen feet away, then sauntered casually across the road and stood on the pavement, blocking her path.She stopped, and he was pleased to see she looked a little startled. "Hello," he said softly, and her eyes widened slightly. She had a delicate, pretty face, he thought. "I like your bag," he said now, pointing at it with one extended arm."Thank you," she said crisply, which surprised him, since most of the women were too scared to speak. Funny how reactions differed. Maybe she was foreign.With his other hand he showed her the knife. It was a seven-inch blade, with a sweeping crescent curve that ended in a honed point. The Americans called them Bowie knives-Jackson liked the name. He said, "Give me the bag."The woman didn't panic. That was a relief; the last thing he wanted was for her to scream. She just nodded, then reached with her left arm and unhooked the bag from her shoulder. She held the bag's handles with one hand, and he started to reach forward to take it, then realised she was rummaging in it with the other. "Just hand it over," he was saying as the woman withdrew her hand. It suddenly shot out straight towards him, and something glinted in the dark. He felt an agonising pain in his left arm, right below his shoulder. "<i>Jesus!</i>" he shouted, wincing. What had she just done to him? He looked and saw blood spurting from his arm. The pain was excruciating. I'm going to cut you bitch, he thought, full of rage. He began to move forward, but the metal implement she held glinted again and jabbed him sharply in the middle of his chest. Once, then twice, each time causing him to flinch. He was in agony, and when Jackson saw the woman's hand move again, he turned and ran as fast as he could. He reached the corner, clutching his wounded arm, and thought who the hell was that? Whoever she was, Jackson decided, as blood continued to ooze through his fingers, he'd picked the wrong lady.Looking around her carefully, she saw that there was no one else in the square. Good. Calmly, she took a tissue out and wiped the end of the Stanley knife, sticky from her assailant's blood, then retracted the blade. Normally she would never have resisted a street robbery, but there had been no way she was going to give the man her bag.A light went on outside one of the houses and a curtain was drawn back, so she moved away quickly, still holding the Stanley knife, in case the man was waiting for her, ready to have another go. But leaving the square, she saw no one on the pavement ahead of her. A taxi passed by; it held a couple, necking in the back. At the corner she turned into a small side street which ended in a cul-de-sac. She stopped at the entrance to a large mansion block, let herself in, then climbed to the second floor. Here she unlocked a door and entered a flat, turning on a light in the small sitting room. The place was sparsely furnished by the landlord, gloomy in its bareness. But it didn't matter to her. She wasn't staying long-she only rented for a month at a time, and this was her third place. She knew that once her orders came she would be living far more comfortably.She went to the bedroom where two computer bags sat in the corner, and carried them both to the pine desk in the sitting room. One bag held a small black machine that resembled a sleek sort of CD player; the other was a laptop computer. Connecting the two with a USB cable, she pressed a button on the black machine, and watched as it transferred to the laptop data that it had recorded in her absence. On the computer she then ran a software routine that filled the screen with numbers.Sitting down in front of the desk, she reached into her own bag, the one the man had tried to take from her, and took out a large, hardcover book. It was a novel, well-thumbed-<i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>. She wondered idly if she would ever read it.She opened the book, flicked through it and finding the page she wanted carefully put it down next to the computer and drew up a chair.Twenty minutes later she was finished. On a scratch pad she had a list of numbers, each with an accompanying word she had written down. She stood up now, and took the single page of Russian text to the lavatory, where she ripped it into small pieces before flushing it away. She put the black machine and the laptop into their respective carrying bags, then returned them to the bedroom.Finally, she came back to the desk. She decided to allow herself a cigarette, and fished in her bag for a pack of Marlboros. What she really craved was a Sobranie. Presumably one of the fancy tobacconists in London, like Davidoff's, would sell them. But Marlboros would have to do, she thought, as she lit her cigarette. <i>Always remember</i>, they had drilled her again and again, <i>it's the little things you think don't matter that can give you away.</i> She had memorised the message on the single page of text and now she ran over it in her mind, focusing on the key instruction. <i>You should begin now.</i> 2 I suppose it all went as well as could be expected." Charles Wetherby was standing by the window of his office, looking down at the Thames, where the little waves bristled, sawtoothed in the late November wind. A tourist cruising boat moved jerkily in the chop, its decks empty, the few passengers sitting snugly in the cabin below. "Thank goodness it was no worse," said Liz Carlyle from her chair in front of Wetherby's desk. She had given evidence to the inquiry for over three hours; Wetherby had been there a day and a half. Now he looked tired, strained, and unusually for him, made no effort to disguise it. Sighing, he rubbed a palm against his cheekbone thoughtfully, then turned and faced Liz."DG says you did very well. Not that you ever had anything to worry about." She nodded, wishing she shared his confidence. The fallout from that last operation had not yet subsided. The discovery of a mole in MI5, who had been intent on undermining the Service, was likely to reverberate for years to come. As the Home Secretary had taken to saying, with the monotony of a mantra, "If the Security Service isn't fit for purpose, how the hell can we win the war on terrorism?" The same Home Secretary had insisted on an inquiry into the whole sorry business. Fortunately he'd eventually grasped that a public inquiry would be a disaster, so it had been held in closed session, chaired by a former Cabinet secretary, assisted by a judge and a trusted businessman. No prying press, no trial by headline; no MPs posturing in some parliamentary committee room for the benefit of the cameras. The report when it came had been a model of Whitehall-ese, beautifully expressed, utterly undramatic, no blame, reasonably fair. "What will happen now?" asked Liz. Wetherby moved back to his desk, sitting down and picking up a pencil. He tapped distractedly on a pile of papers. "There'll be a review of recruitment, enhanced vetting procedures . . . other things. But as I say, you've got nothing to worry about." "Have you, Charles?" she asked. It had been Wetherby himself who had predicted heads would roll after the near-debacle and the Thames House rumour mill had suggested Wetherby's would be one. He shrugged, leaning back in his chair. He was not as engaged as usual, which alarmed Liz. What else could he be thinking about? Finally he said, "I'd like to think it will be all right for me as well. But who knows? I've learnt these things are hard to predict. Anyway, I won't be here for the aftermath. I'm taking some leave." "Oh," she said. He heard the question in her voice. She was wondering whether this was voluntary. "It's my choice, Liz." Wetherby looked at her. "I'm entitled to a sabbatical and I've decided I should spend some time at home." He gestured with a quick motion of his head at a framed photograph of his wife and sons. Liz nodded. This was why he seemed so subdued. Joanne Wetherby had been seriously ill for as long as Liz had known Charles-over five years. It could not have been easy, juggling his job with his role as the husband of an invalid and the father of two boys. She was sure he would miss the challenge, the excitement, and the colleagues. And her, Liz wondered, would he miss her?Liz asked, "How long will you be away?" Wetherby shrugged, and flicked a non-existent piece of fluff off his suit jacket. "I'm not sure. Perhaps three months, something like that. We'll have to see how things go. While I'm away, Michael Binding will run the branch."Oh God, thought Liz, not that condescending oaf. They'd crossed swords more than once...</p><h2>Of Minnie the Moocher &amp; Me</h2><p>From dust jacket notes: &#34;From the back streets of Baltimore where he hustled as a kid, through the jazz clubs of Chicago in the raw and roaring twenties, to the Cotton Club, Hollywood, Paris, and beyond, here in his own words is the story of Cab Calloway - the man who made Minnie the Moocher a household heroine and became one of the most respected jazz musicians and best loved entertainers in America. He sang and danced like no other performer of his time. Tall, slender, handsome and resplendent in a white zoot suit, his presence on stage was electric. &#39;Hi-de-hi-de-ho,&#39; he&#39;d sing. &#39;Hi-de-hi-de-ho,&#39; the audience would answer. &#39;Wah-de-do-de-way-de-ho,&#39; he&#39;d intone. &#39;Wah-de-do-de-way-de-ho,&#39; they&#39;d roar back. And on it would go until the crowd was singing and stomping and dancing in the aisles. It was the Great Depression, but he made them forget. More than that, he made them happy. That has always been Cab Calloway&#39;s profession - and the secret of his monumental success - knowing how to make people happy.

It exposes assumptions about gender, politicising the link between private and public, and stressing the specificity of art marked by gender, race, age and class.</p><p>No question about it, <i>Art and Feminism</i> is <i>the</i> basic reference book for feminist art. Part of Phaidon's excellent Themes and Movements series, it surveys three decades of a tumultuous history with a brief but inclusive essay, reproductions of works by 155 artists, and lengthy excerpts from groundbreaking texts by artists and theorists. The challenge posed by a movement that spans several artistic generations and includes many contentious players is ably met by essayist Peggy Phelan, professor of performance studies at New York University. She illuminates the intertwined workings of feminist politics and literary criticism, psychoanalysis, race and queer theory with clarity and a refreshing absence of doctrinaire pronouncements. <p> The illustrations are organized chronologically under sometimes quirky headings, beginning with "Too Much" (late-'60s performance pieces by such pioneering figures as Carolee Schneemann, Miriam Schapiro, Eva Hesse, Louise Bourgeois, and Yayoi Kusama). The final section, "Femmes de Si�cle," contains work from the '90s by Coco Fusco, Kara Walker, Mona Hatoum, Jenny Saville, and others exploring "collective memories ... and traumas." Essays range from the raw invective of Valerie Solanas's "Scum Manifesto" (1967) to the reasoned arguments of Adrian Piper's "The Triple Negation of Colored Women Artists" (1990). While some may argue that the book could be more inclusive--it deals overwhelmingly with women artists who exhibit in major Western cultural centers--it offers an unparalleled breadth of reference. Irked by the perfect bodies of many feminist artists who use nudity in their work, I was struck by the poignancy and honesty of Hannah Wilke--a glamorous figure in '70s and '80s performance art--who chose to memorialize her bald, bloated self in photographs months before her untimely death from cancer in 1993. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Helena Reckitt is an independent writer and arts organizer with a long-standing critical research interest in feminist art and theory.

James&#x2019;s trademark suspense, insightful characterization, and riveting storytelling, <i>The Children of Men</i> is a story of a world with no children and no future. <br><br>The human race has become infertile, and the last generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron, apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just awaken his desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival for the human race.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>P.

If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.<br><br>As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.<br><br>Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.<br><br>We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>White Snow, Bright Snow (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Told from the perspective of the key decision-makers on the Turco-German side, many of the most consequential events of World War I&#x2014;Turkey&#x2019;s entry into the war, Gallipoli, the Armenian massacres, the Arab revolt, and the Russian Revolution&#x2014;are illuminated as never before.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Drawing on a wealth of new sources, McMeekin forces us to re-examine Western interference in the Middle East and its lamentable results.

Wright, a journalist and a lawyer turned SF and fantasy writer, lives with his wife and son in Centreville, Virginia.<br>Phoenix Exultant, The<br>1THE CYBORG1.He opened the door onto a crowded boulevard of matter-shops, drama-spaces, reliquaries, shared-form communion theaters, colloquy-salons, and flower parks. An elaborate hydrosculpture of falls and aerial brooks spread from a central fountain works throughout the area, with running water held aloft by subatomic reorientations of its surface tension, so that arches and bows of shining transparency rose or fell, splashed or surged with careless indifference to the reality of gravity. Light, scattered from tall windows lining the concourse or from banners of advertisements or from high panels opening up into the regional mentality, was caught and made into rainbows by the high-flowing waters. Petals from floating water lilies drifted down across the scene.Beneath all this beauty was a crass ugliness. More than three-quarters of the people were present as mannequins. This was evidently a place meant for manorials, cryptics, or other schools that relied heavily on telepresentation. Since Phaethon no longer had access to any kind of sense-filter, all these folk, no matter how splendid of dress or elegant of comportment they might have appeared to an observer in the Surface Dreaming, looked to him like so many ranks and ranks of gray, dull, and faceless mannequins.There may have been beautiful music sweeping the area; excluded from the mentality, Phaethon was deaf to it. Here and there were hospice boxes or staging pools, ready to send out dreams orpartials, calls, messages, or any form of telepresentation. All channels were closed to Phaethon, and he was mute. There were dragon-signs burning like fire in the air, displaying messages of unknown import. Phaethon could not read the subtext or hypertext; Phaethon was illiterate. There may have been thought-guides in the Middle Dreaming to allow him to remember, as if he had always known, where to find the public transport he sought. Mnemonic assistance gone; Phaethon was an amnesiac. There may have been ornament and pageantry in the dream-stages gathered in the air around him, lovely beyond description, or signs and maps to show Phaethon where, in this wide concourse, might be the way or the road he sought. But Phaethon was blind.Here and there among the mannequins, the face of a realist or vivarianist showed. Their eyes turned dull when they lit on Phaethon, and their gazes slid past him without seeing. All sense-filters were tuned to exclude him. The world was blind to him as well.He expected the banners overhead to swoop down on him when he looked up. But no. They floated on by, shouting with lights and garish displays. Even the advertisements ignored him.No matter. Phaethon tried to keep his thoughts only on the next steps immediately before him. How to find out where he was? How to find Talaimannar? How to go from here to there? Once there, how to find out why Harrier Sophotech recommended that place?He had to ask someone for help, or directions.Phaethon stepped behind a stand of bushes; there was a flow of water from the fountain works overhead, forming a rippling, translucent ceiling. Was anyone watching? He assumed not.He doffed his armor and covered it with the cape of nanomaterial, which he then programmed to look like a hooded cloak. Phaethon himself merely drew out some of the nanomaterial from the black skin-garment he wore, and drew circles around his eyes, to solidify into a black domino mask. And that was that: Both of them were now in disguise. He hoped it was enough to fool at least a casual inspection. He programmed the suit to follow him at a fixed distance, avoiding obstacles; to "heel" as Daphne would have said.He stepped out again into the concourse, followed by the bulky, cloaked form of his armor, looming three paces behind him. Hewent downstairs and found a pondside esplanade that had fewer mannequins walking along it. He saw real faces; faces made of flesh or metal, or cobra scales, or polystructural material, or energy surfaces. They were laughing and talking, signaling and depicting. The air seemed charged with a carnival excitement. Many people skipped or danced as they strolled, moved by music Phaethon could not hear. Others dived over the side of the esplanade, to glide among the buildings and statues in the pond.He did not know what particular event was being celebrated. It was rare to see so many folk together. Whatever bunting or decoration swam in the dreamspace here, which might have given him a clue as to the nature of the occasion, was, of course, invisible to him.People smiled and nodded at him as they walked by, full of good cheer. "Merry Millennium! May you live a thousand years!"He had not realized how much he had missed, and was going to miss, the sight of friendly human faces. Phaethon smiled back, waving, and calling out, "And a thousand years to you!"Phaethon reminded himself that he had to be careful. Theoretically, the masquerade protocol would not protect him, since he was no longer part of the celebration, no longer part of the community. But how many people would even try to read his identity if they saw him wearing a mask during a masquerade? Most people, Phaethon guessed, would not.The rule from the Hortators was that no one was to give him aid, comfort, food or drink, or shelter, sell him goods or services, or buy from him, or donate charity to him. This rule did not (in theory) actually prohibit speaking to him, or looking at him and smiling, although that was the way it surely would be practiced.If Phaethon tried to buy something from a passerby, Aurelian was obligated to warn him that he was about to be contaminated with exile. But as long as Phaethon did not try to win from the passersby either food or drink or comfort or shelter or charity, Aurelian would no doubt stand mute. Sophotechs had a long, long tradition of failing to volunteer any information that had not been specifically asked.It was hard. A couple walking hand in hand were passing outwedding-album projections of their future children. Phaethon smiled but declined to take one. A young girl (or someone dressed as one), skipping and licking a floating balloon-pastry offered him a bite; Phaethon patted her on the head, but did not touch her pastry. When a laughing wine-juggler, surrounded by musical firecrackers, and balancing on a ball, rolled by and tried to thrust a glass of champaign into Phaethon's hand, Phaethon was not able to refuse except by jerking his hand away.The juggler frowned, wondering at Phaethon's lack of courtesy, and raised two fingers as if to try to find out who Phaethon really was. But the juggler was distracted when a slender, naked gyno-morph, fluttering with a hundred stimulation scarves, jumped up in drunken passion to embrace him. Singing a carol to Aphrodite, the two rolled off together, while the juggler's bottles and goblets fell this way and that.Phaethon let the throng carry him down the esplanade.The pressure of the crowd eased when Phaethon came to a line of windows, two hundred feet tall or more, which looked out upon a balcony larger than a boulevard. Out onto the balcony they all went together. Phaethon climbed up a pedestal holding a statue of Orpheus in his pose as Father of the Second Immortality. The stone hands held up a symbol in the shape of a snake swallowing its own tail. Phaethon put his foot in the stone coils of the serpent and pulled himself high, looking left and right above the heads of the crowd.Several lesser towers and small skyscrapers grew up from the railing of the balcony, like little corals fringing the topless super-tower of the space elevator.Beyond the balcony, the metropolis spread out from the mountain-base of the space elevator in three concentric circles. Innermost and oldest, the center circle consisted of huge windowless structures shaped according to simple geometries; giant cubes, hemispheres, and hemicylinders, painted in bright, primary colors, connected by rectilinear motion-lines and smart roads. The architecture followed the Objective Aesthetic, with the building shapes, slabs, and plaques all rigidly stereotyped. There was little movement in this part of the city; human beings of the basic neuroformtended to find these faceless buildings and looming monoliths intolerable. Mostly, this central ring housed Sophotech components, warehouses, manufacturies. Invariants, who had little desire for beauty or pleasure or inefficiency, lived here, dwelling in square dormitories arranged like rank upon rank of coffin-beds.The second ring was done in the Standard Aesthetic. Here were black pools and lakes of nanomachinery, with many brooks and rills, touched with white foam of the dark material streaming from one to another. Tiny waterfalls of the material formed where cascade-separator stages mixed and organized the components. Each lake was surrounded by the false-trees and coral bioformations of na-nomanufactory. A hundred solar parasols raised orchidlike colors to the sun. The houses and presence chambers were formed of strange growthlike seashells; one spiral after another, shining with lambent mother-of-pearl, rose to the skyline. Blue-black, dark pearl, glinting silver, and dappled blue-gray hues dominated the scene. Thought-gardens, coven places, and sacred circles dotted the area, along with nymphariums, mother trees, and staging pools. Warlocks and basics tended to prefer the chaotic fractals and organic shapes of the Standard Aesthetic. Wide areas of garden space were occupied by the decentralized bodies of Cerebellines.Beyond this, on the hills surrounding, green arbors and white mansions prevailed. This was the Consensus Aesthetic, patronized mostly by manor-born and first-generation basics. Greek columns marched along the hilltops; formal English gardens rested in green shadows before grand houses done in the Georgian style, or neo-Roman, or stern Alexandrian.In the far distance, Phaethon saw a wide lake. On the lake were a hundred shapes like jewel-armored clipper ships, whose sails were textured like a dozen wings of butterflies, surrounded with light.Now Phaethon knew where he was. This city was Kisumu, south of Aetheopia, overlooking Lake Victoria. And Phaethon understood the wonder and excitement of the crowd. For the huge shapes in the lake were the Deep Ones.These were the last of the once-great race of the Jovian half-warlocks, a unique neuroform that combined elements from the Cerebellineand Warlock nervous-system structures. Once, they rode the storms and swam in the pressurized methane atmosphere of Jupiter, before its ignition. When the time came to end their way of life, they chose instead to enter whalelike bodies and to sleep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, where they called back and forth to each other, and wove songs and sonar images relating to the vast, sad, and ancient emotions known only to them; and made sounds in the deep, which reminded them, but could not recapture, those songs and sensations their old Jupiter-adapted Behemoth bodies once had made in the endless atmosphere of that gas-giant planet.Once every thousand years, only during the time of the Millennium, they woke from their dreams of sorrow, grew festive gems and multicolored membranes and sails along their upper hulls, rose to the surface, and sang in the air.By an ancient contract, no recordings could be made of their great songs, nor was anyone allowed to speak of what they heard or dreamed when that music swept over them.No wonder so many people were here in reality.Phaethon's heart was in his throat. The songs of the Deep Ones he had only heard once before, since he had not attended this ceremony his second millennial masquerade, during Argentorium's tenure. That time once before, three thousand years ago (during the tenure of Cuprician) the song had sung to him of vastness, emptiness, and a sense of infinite promise. It was as if Phaethon had been plunged into the wide expanses of the Jovian cloudscape; or into the far wider expanses of the stars beyond.The Deep Ones had originally been designed also to serve as living spaceships, able to swim the radiation-filled and dust-filled vacuum between the Jovian moons, able to tolerate the almost unthinkable re-entry heat of low-orbit dives down into the Jovian atmosphere. But the early successes in cleaning circumjovial space and in taming the Jovian magnetosphere, made those space-lanes safe and economical for ships of ordinary construction; the emplacements of sky hooks made alarming re-entries unnecessary. The Deep Ones' way of life was past; the danger and romance of space travel was removed. Phaethon had heard all of this in their song,so long ago. It had planted the seed that blossomed into his own desire to embrace his dream of star travel.It had been Daphne who had brought him to hear it. But had that been Daphne Prime, or her ambassador-doll, Daphne Tercius? Phaethon could not remember. Perhaps his lack of useful sleep was beginning to affect his memory.Phaethon jumped down from the pedestal and began to push his way through the crowd, and away. For the Deep Ones did not give away their grand, sad music freely. Everyone who did not exclude the music from his sense filter would have a fee charged to his account; and, when the computers detected that Phaethon could not pay, he would be unmasked. Once Phaethon was unmasked, no one, of course, would help him. Not to mention that the performance would be delayed, and the afternoon spoiled for everyone. (He was amazed to discover that he still cared about the convenience and pleasure of his fellowmen, even though they had ostracized him. But the wonder of that first Deep One symphony he had once heard still haunted his memory. He did not want to diminish the joy of folk happier than he.)The crowd thinned as he rounded the space elevator, and came to the side facing away from the lake. Several dirigible airships, as large as whales themselves, were docked with their noses touching the towers rising from the balcony sides. They had dragon-signs in the air, displaying their routes and times in a format Phaethon could not read.Phaethon stopped a passerby, a woman dressed as a pyretic. "Pardon me, miss, but my companion and I are looking for the way to Talaimannar." He gestured toward the hooded and cloaked figure of his armor, standing silently behind him. He spoke what was not quite a lie: "My companion and I are involved in a masquerade game of hunt-and-seek, and we are not allowed to access the mentality. Could you tell me how to find the nearest smart road?"She cocked her head at him. Her dancing eyes were surrounded by wreaths of flame, and smoke curled from her lips when she smiled. When she spoke, Phaethon had no routine to translate her words into his language and grammar and logic.He tried more simply: "Talaimannar ... ? Talaimannar ... ? Smart road?" He pantomimed sliding along a frictionless surface, hands waving, so that she giggled.By her emphatic gesture he understood she meant that the smart roads were not running; she pointed him toward a nearby airship and pushed him lightly on the shoulder, as if to say, Go! Go!Phaethon froze. Had she just helped him, or offered him passage on some ship owned by her? There was no alarm in her eyes; to judge from her expression, there was no secret voice from Aurelian warning her. And the woman was turning away, drawn by the movement of the crowd. Evidently she was not the owner.Phaethon ...</p><h2>Draw Near to God: 100 Bible Verses to Deepen Your Faith</h2><p><p>It's hard to believe sometimes, but the God who created the universe and everything in it desires a relationship with each of us.

In her considerable experience, there are seven rules whose importance cannot be ignored, and which must never be broken if true, meaningful success is the goal. In the tradition of bestsellers like Maria Shriver's <em>And One More Thing Before You Go</em>, Anna Quindlen's <em>A Short Guide to a Happy Life</em>, and Marlo Thomas <em>The Right Words at the Right Time</em>, <em>From the Heart</em> is the perfect gift for new grads, and an inspiring read for anyone searching for the path to success.</p></p><p><strong>Robin Roberts</strong> was named the third anchor of <em>Good Morning America</em> in May 2005.

Smith is Professor of New Testament at Phillips Theological Seminary (Tulsa, Oklahoma). He is an editor and contributor to the Storyteller&#x2019;s Companion to the Bible series, as well as co-author of Many Tables: The Eucharist in the New Testament and Liturgy Today (1990). He is the editor of the forthcoming Chalice Introduction to the New Testament.from chapter 9 &#34;The primary change from symposium to eucharist is the evolution of the ritual from the dining table to the altar and from the social world of the banquet to that of sacred law. This change took place rather quickly and can be documented in early Christian literature. It represented a transition from the social code of the banquet to another social code. The banquet tradition was carried on somewhat longer in the form of the Agape, or fellowship meal. This ritual meal co-existed with the eucharist for some time and tended to carry the traditions of the banquet. The eucharist, on the other hand, soon lost its connection with banquet traditions. New Testament texts, however, still maintain that connection and provide a means for the church ever and again to reexamine its origins and renew its theology by recapturing and reconfiguring its own traditions.&#34;</p><h2>Keto Diet Instant Pot Cookbook: For Rapid Weight Loss And A Better lifestyle- Top 101 Quick, Easy &amp; Delicious Low Carb Ketogenic Diet Instant Pot ...

Moser: Artistry in Wood</h2><p>Feted by aficionados of woodcraft for his reverence of historical forms and traditions, attention to elegant proportions, and devotion to exquisite detail, Thomas Moser has achieved the highest quality in the creation of fine furniture. Here, in his own words, the world-renowned woodworker recounts the history of his workshop, Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers, and provides insight into the philosophy, materials, and processes that are the foundation of his style. Moser furniture references Arts and Crafts, Mission, Shaker, and Japanese styles, but is always completely original and meticulously hand-finished. Lavishly illustrated with over 300 full-color and black-and-white photographs and shop drawings, this is a sumptuous celebration of a master artisan and his oeuvre.</p><p>Thomas F. Moser is president and founder of Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers of Auburn, Maine.<br><br>Brad Lemley is a writer and woodworker whose articles have appeared in <i>This Old House</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, Discover, and many other publications.Former college professor Moser began furniture making more than a quarter century ago, and artistry of design and quality of craftsmanship remain signatures of his company, Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers of Auburn, ME. This volume is an exploration of the man, the career, and the company, as Moser himself moves away from daily operations. After a humorous foreword by Andy Rooney, five chapters co-written by Moser and Lemley (a woodworker and journalist) give an overview of the legendary company. The first two chapters, "Origins" and "A Covenant with Wood," present a focused and concise exploration of the beauty of the Moser furniture. The next three emphasize the company itself and are more specifically useful to the woodworker. More than 300 full-color photographs demonstrate the textual points, and whimsical design drawings and construction details appear as well. Less a woodworker's manual than a celebration of the artful designs, this delightful volume is an inspiring coda to this artist's career. The only caveat: an index would have been useful. Highly recommended for all furniture collections.<br><i>Alex Hartmann, INFOPHILE, Williamsport, PA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Release the Power of Prayer</h2><p>George Muller was once a thief and a liar, but after turning to Christ he became an extraordinary example of a prayer warrior. Discover how to trust God and seek His answers to your every need. You can experience the same miraculous hand of God at work in your life today.</p><p>Receive Your Miracle from GodGeorge Mller was the worst of sinners--a thief and a liar. But after turning to Christ, he provided for over 10,000 orphans--without ever asking anyone but God to supply his needs! He testified that he knew of at least 50,000 specific answers to his prayers. Here are his reports of a few of the most spectacular ones.From his amazing personal experiences, you will find the secret to receiving miraculous answers to your prayers.<b>George M�ller</b> (1805&#x2013;1898) was born in Kroppenstaedt, Prussia, on September 27, 1805. He was the son of a tax collector, and, before he became a Christian, he had the reputation of a liar and a thief. After accepting Christ as his personal Savior, he was used in remarkable ways to provide for over 10,000 orphans during his lifetime. He never went into debt or asked anyone to supply his needs. He trusted in God to provide for him and for the orphans, and God never failed to do so.<br> In 1834, he established the Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad. Its objectives were to assist day schools and adult schools, where instruction was given based on scriptural principles; enable poor children to attend these day schools; circulate the Holy Scriptures; and aid in supplying the needs of missionaries and missionary schools. The fifth objective, which was added later, was to provide for the needs of orphaned children.<br> By the 1870s, God enabled George M�ller to build five large orphanages on Ashley Down in Bristol, England, and to send �10,000 annually to nearly two hundred missionaries.<br> In 1875, he began preaching tours that took him over 200,000 miles to 42 countries to preach to 3 million people. God transformed a little boy who stole from his earthly father into a man who could be trusted with the resources of his heavenly Father.<br> The ministry of George M�ller continues today through the establishment of the George M�ller Foundation. Three charities operate under the direction of the Foundation: The M�ller Homes for Children, the M�ller Homes for the Elderly, and the Scriptural Knowledge Institution.

Here's proof that evolution is fighting the same battle. Lust, vanity, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, and wrath: all are fatal when carried to excess. From sensual skunk play to the vanity of amateur liposuction, indulgence in the deadly vices leads to trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Discussion: Kismet, Karma, Destiny</p><p><br></p><p>Are you superstitious?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We enjoy believing in abstract balancing principles. There ought to be a force that gives each what he's earned, call it kismet, karma, or destiny. And yet we also believe in the opposite&#x2014;lucky slot machines and winning streaks. Don't you sometimes walk around a ladder, or kiss your exam paper for good luck? Superstitious beliefs are imbedded in our personalities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Darwin Awards celebrate another sort of religion&#x2014;that of final justice according to the divine laws of nature. Darwin winners suffer a practical form of karma. They prove our theory that if you don't use your head to enhance your survival, you'll be fingered by the impartial hand of fate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a solid basis for the "religion" of the Darwin Awards: Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In a single lifetime one finds ample proof that natural selection leads to evolution. We've seen evolution happen before our very eyes. Broccoli, dog breeds, nectarines, and modern corn all resulted from random mutations combined with natural (or artificial) selection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeds provide an example of evolution happening in your own front lawn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dandelions are ubiquitous and very difficult to eliminate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A handful of wild dandelion seeds will grow into adults of assorted heights, which scatter their seeds far and wide to begin the process again. But weekly lawn mowing schedules are a new selective pressure! We created a new environmental hazard for dandelions. And they rose, or rather shrunk, to meet the challenge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular cutting of lawns selects for very short dandelions, ones that hug the ground too closely to be slashed by mower blades, and send up flowers that seed within days to avoid the reaper's scythe. A new short dandelion variant is branching off the general dandelion population. Over time the lawn dandelions may well diverge from the wild dandelions, increasingly specialized for the modern lawn environment, and a new species&#x2014;the lawnlion?&#x2014;will dawn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because examples of natural selection are easy to come by, the "religion" of the Darwin Awards stands on firm scientific footing. The interesting and powerful mechanism of natural selection is a blindly omniscient tool to increase the long-term survival of the human race&#x2014;and provide a measure of immortality to comfort our transient personal existence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories that follow show the Darwinian repercussions to those who ignore religious strictures, and indulge in the seven deadly sins.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Darwin Award: Vanity<br>Liposuction Tragedy</b><br></p><p><i>Unconfirmed by Darwin</i></p><p>September 1999, New York</p><p><br></p><p>David, a forty-four-year-old Mineola man, was more desperate to be rid of his flab than most.

Then, on a warm suburban night in the Kleins&#x2019; affluent New Jersey neighborhood, a young woman&#x2014;a girl Will had once loved&#x2014;was found brutally murdered in her family&#x2019;s basement. The prime suspect: Ken Klein. With the evidence against him overwhelming, Ken simply vanished. And when his shattered family never heard from Ken again, they were sure he was gone for good. <br><br>Now eleven years have passed. Will has found proof that Ken is alive. And this is just the first in a series of stunning revelations as Will is forced to confront startling truths about his brother, and even himself. As a violent mystery unwinds around him, Will knows he must press his search all the way to the end. Because the most powerful surprises are yet to come.</p><p>"The ugliest truth, in the end, was still better than the prettiest of lies." So says Will Klein, whose search for his missing and allegedly murderous brother, Ken, leaves him doubting the actions of everybody he's ever loved.<p> Eleven years ago, Ken fled his family's suburban New Jersey neighborhood after Will's ex-girlfriend, Julie Miller, was raped and strangled. The Kleins eventually convinced themselves that Ken perished on the lam. But as Will discovers, the facts are not so simple. On her deathbed, his mother tells him that Ken is still alive. Then Will's girlfriend and "soul mate" disappears too, only to have her fingerprints turn up at a New Mexico homicide scene. How are these tragedies connected? And what's their relationship to the recent appearance of a contract killer known as the Ghost? With help from an abused ex-hooker, a former white supremacist turned yoga guru, and Julie's younger sister, Will finds himself in a tightly twisted plot that turns on double identities and misplaced trust and that forces him to dig for the courage he was always sure he lacked.</p><p> Although the premise sounds much like that of Harlan Coben's last book, the acclaimed <i>Tell No One</i>, and the books' ingenuous protagonists are nearly interchangeable, <i>Gone for Good</i> quickly establishes its separate but equally suspenseful identity.

The household includes her husband, Don, and the studio dog, Lucy.<br>Karla has written several books on the art of quiltmaking. She also has a pattern line under the name Saginaw Street Quilts and she is a designer for Creative Grids Rulers. As the years have rolled by, she has watched, enjoyed, and been intrigued by the changes in the quilt industry and has always found her niche there, one way or another. Karla is fascinated and inspired by the patterns found in everyday life--baskets, freeways, the view from an airplane window, doorframes, you name it. The patterns she sees are often reinvented as quilts or provide the springboard for many of her designs.<br>As a teacher, Karla enjoys immersing herself among her students, knowing there is a lot to be learned from each one of them as well.<br></p>Karla Alexander's simple stack the deck techniques (previously used with straight line cuts) have inspired thousands of quilts. In her latest book <i>Dynamic Quilts with Easy Curves</i>, she applies this technique to curves. It is a simple premise--you stack your fabrics, and then make one curved cut, shuffle the pile and stitch together again. The results are somewhat serendipitous, but with careful choice of fabrics, can be spectacular. The more complex designs appear intricate and there's plenty of scope for experimentation for novice and experienced quilters alike. --New Zealand Quilter Magazine<br><br><em>Dynamic Quilts with Easy Curves: 19 Projects to Stack, Shuffle and Sew</em> provides crafters with a fine set of beginner-friendly projects designed to teach the basics of curved piecing without headache.

True to Karla's style of "stacking the deck" and "free-form cutting" detailed in her previous books, she gives explicit instructions for each of the 19 projects (as well as information on using her optional specialty rulers, which make the cutting process even easier). However, with the exception of a few designs, each curve can be replaced by a straight cut.

He lives in Edina, Minnesota.Strong opening action sequences-particularly of a tornado touching down in the Twin Cities-and an atmospheric TV newsroom setting don't quite compensate for the scattered story line and indulgent prose that mar Thayer's second novel (after Saint Mudd). The police find the first victim, as well as a partial fingerprint, presumably from the killer, outside the Channel 7 studio on the last day of spring, just before a tornado rips a deadly swath through Minneapolis-St. Paul. After two more women are killed, one in summer and one in the fall, the cops step up their efforts to identify the fingerprint and find the "Calendar Killer." When unloved weatherman Dixon Graham Bell is arrested for the murders, newswriter Rick Beanblosson, a disfigured Vietnam vet, teams up with anchorwoman and new romantic interest Andrea Labore to save him from Minnesota's newly reinstated death penalty. Thayer's depiction of TV journalism feels on target, but he fills his cast with so many unusual and often outre characters that the story takes on a cartoonish air. Still, with its reams of meteorological lore, an ironic twist ending and impassioned stance against capital punishment, this should appeal to weather buffs as well as to thriller fans looking for something a bit off the beaten serial-killer path. 60,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thrilling Escapes by Night</h2><p>&#34;They talk in that manner of the godly man under our roof!

We were silent for a moment with the blooms between us.

Rocking on a stream that flowed from her eyes. Maybe I spoke bluntly to dull my own pain, maybe I just wanted to be cruel so that when she&#x2019;d left she could curse me and my callousness, or maybe I yearned for some final declaration, for her to say she didn&#x2019;t want to leave. I was still uncertain of the movements of her heart, even after all we&#x2019;d been through together.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You regret bringing me here,&#x201d; Juudit whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was startled by her perceptiveness, rubbed my neck in embarrassment.

But I had to bring her to the safety of the forest when I heard that she&#x2019;d had to flee from Tallinn. The Armses&#x2019; farm wasn&#x2019;t a safe place for us with the Russians advancing. The forest was better. She&#x2019;d been like an injured bird in the palm of my hand, weakened, her nerves feverish for weeks. When our medic was killed in combat, the men finally let Mrs. Vaik come to help us, us and Juudit. I had succeeded in rescuing her one more time, but once she stepped out onto the road that loomed ahead of us, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to protect her anymore. The men were right, though&#x2014;women and children belonged at home. Juudit had to go back to town. The noose around us was tightening and the safety of the forest was melting away. I watched her face out of the corner of my eye. Her gaze had turned to the road that she would leave by; her mouth was open, she was gulping the air with all her strength, and the feel of her breath threatened to undermine my resolve.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s best this way,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Best for all of us.

In this lively and eclectic cookbook, the Fiddlehead Restaurant team presents 150 of its most acclaimed, sought-after recipes. The colorful collection ranges from fresh Alaskan salmon and halibut to robust soups and sandwiches, light and healthy pasts dishes, grilled meats and stirfries, authentic sourdough breads, edible greens, wildberries, and extraordinarily delicious deserts.At first glance, Fiddlehead smacks of political correctness: readers are informed by its founders that the Fiddlehead restaurant, located in Juneau, Alaska, uses only organic ingredients and purchases products from socially responsible companies. But, setting propriety aside, we find food for vegetarians and carnivores. And those in the Lower 48 who think Alaskans dine on whale blubber and raw fish are in for a pleasant surprise. The Fiddlehead cooks don't confine themselves to things Alaskan; standards--shrimp scampi, eggplant parmesan--put in an appearance. The regional recipes, however, are the most intriguing. Yes, fiddlehead ferns are edible, and fiddlehead pesto sounds delicious. So does Alaskan salmon, variously prepared. Snippets of information concern everything from nagoon berries to beach asparagus. Advice and alternatives abound; directions are almost too explicit. (Even the inexperienced will know that zest is the shiny part of the peel.)

The book examines the preemption and unilateralism used to instill democracy during Epaminondas's great invasion of the Peloponnesus in 369 BC, as well as the counterinsurgency and terrorism that characterized Rome's battles with insurgents such as Spartacus, Mithridates, and the Cilician pirates. The collection looks at the urban warfare that became increasingly common as more battles were fought within city walls, and follows the careful tactical strategies of statesmen as diverse as Pericles, Demosthenes, Alexander, Pyrrhus, Caesar, and Augustus. <i>Makers of Ancient Strategy</i> shows how Greco-Roman history sheds light on wars of every age. In addition to the editor, the contributors are David L. Berkey, Adrian Goldsworthy, Peter J. Heather, Tom Holland, Donald Kagan, John W. I. Lee, Susan Mattern, Barry Strauss, and Ian Worthington.</p></p><p><p>"All serious students of military strategy must have on their bookshelves Makers of Modern Strategy. In this essential prequel to that classic volume, Victor Davis Hanson has assembled an all-star team of historians to analyze past conflicts and draw relevant lessons for the present day. If you seek the roots of modern warfighting, look here."--<b>Max Boot, author of <i>War Made New: Technology, Warfare, and the Course of History, 1500 to Today</i></b></p><p>"In this outstanding collection, ancient historian and thoroughly modern pundit Victor Davis Hanson has assembled a gleaming cohort of historians who deepen our understanding of the constants of warfare and illuminate brightly the peculiarities of strategy in the worlds of ancient Greece and Rome. Today's makers of strategy and war as well as students of antiquity will be informed and stimulated by fascinating essays that range from Persia and Pericles to Julius Caesar and the Goths, and from mass foreign invasion to street fighting and counterinsurgency."--<b>Paul Cartledge, author of <i>Alexander the Great</i></b></p><p>"Though the technology has changed, the nature of war and strategy has remained constant over the chasm of the centuries and millennia. This book makes the ancient Greeks and Romans relevant to our modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

God's Word, according to Ratzinger, is encountered in the Bible, in Tradition, and through the teaching Office of the Bishop, who, through apostolic succession, is to be the servant of and witness to the divine Word. Ratzinger examines as well the relationship between the Episcopacy and the Papacy. He also considers the nature of Apostolic Succession, and he responds to Reformed objections to the Catholic view of the subject. His treatment is sympathetic to the concerns of non-Catholic Christians while remaining faithful to Catholic teaching and practice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This book also includes the famous Erasmus Lecture of Cardinal Ratzinger, which assesses the strengths and weaknesses of modern critical approaches to biblical interpretation. Ratzinger proposes a new approach that avoids the pitfalls of a narrowly critical outlook on the Bible without succumbing to fundamentalism.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>God's Word</i>&nbsp;provides profound insights into Pope Benedict XVI's efforts to renew the Church's participation in God's Truth through the divine Word, as well as the Church's mission to proclaim the Word to all people.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Ratzinger</b> (Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI)&nbsp;is recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age.

Those throwing their hats into the ring have included a formidably imposing German farmer, a trigger-happy Scots baronet, and an ex-British army captain with some rather reckless ideas on how to photograph lions. <p>Such interlopers have had to contend with the Maasai, who believe all the cattle in the world are theirs; conservationists who wish to preserve the Ngorongoro as a natural habitat; and of course the animals themselves, inhabiting the rich grasslands of the crater floor in teeming numbers. </p><p>The Ngorongoro Story traces the history of the crater from the pioneering days of the early explorers, through two world wars, up to recent international efforts to save the natural habitat of the Ngorongoro for posterity.</p></p><p>Tom Lithgow is the ideal person to tell this tale. He has spent much of life on the edge of the crater, and his multi-faceted existence as farmer, safari guide, hunter, journalist, and campaigner gives him a unique insight into the events that have influenced the destiny of the Ngorongoro-and the fascinating personalities who have shaped those events.</p><h2>Lionheart</h2><p><p><b>INTRODUCING LIONHEART - THE NEW NOVEL FROM SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER BEN KANE</b></p><p><b>1179.

A paralytic Jewish woman starts walking after her husband is suffocated by fellow Jews afraid that his coughing would reveal their hiding place to the Germans. A young American man refuses to let go of the ghost of his half brother who died in the Warsaw ghetto. He never knew the boy, yet he learns Polish to communicate with his dybbuk. A high ranking German officer conceives of a plan to kill Hitler after witnessing a mass execution of Jews in Eastern Poland. <br><br>Through Krall's adroit and journalistic style, her reader is thrown into a world where love, hatred, compassion, and indifference appear in places where we least expect them, illuminating the implacable logic of the surreal.<br><br>"It is precisely the difficult path [Krall] takes toward her topic that has made some of these texts masterpieces." <br>-- <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i> (on <i>Dancing at Other People's Weddings</i>) <br><br>"Heartbreaking, strange . . . and marvelously told." <br> -- <i>Die Zeit</i> (on <i>Proofs of Existence</i>)</p><p><b>Hanna Krall</b><br><br>Hanna Krall was born in Warsaw in 1937 and was a reporter for <i>Polityka</i> from 1957 until 1981, when martial law was imposed and her publications were banned.

Levine was Czeslaw Milosz's prose translator. Her translation of Ida Fink's <i>A Scrap of Time and Other Stories</i> was awarded the PEN Book-of-the Month Club Translation Prize.The grim and the surreal portentously collide in Krall's 12 genre-bending pieces, all shadowed by the brutal facts of the Holocaust. In "Hamlet," Andrzej Czajkowski, a Polish piano impresario and composer who survived WWII as a child hiding in wardrobes, bequeaths his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the supernatural "Dybbuk," an American professor of architecture tries to exorcise the tormented spirit of his half-brother, who disappeared in a Jewish ghetto. "Phantom Pain" draws the life of Alex von dem B., a German officer who lost a leg on the Eastern front and plotted to assassinate Hitler after witnessing a massacre of Jews. Conspiracies resurface in "The Back of the Eye"&#x2014;backlit by Cold War terrorism and the violence of the Baader-Meinhof Gang&#x2014;in which Stefan, the son of a concentration camp survivor, serves a life sentence for a 1977 abduction and murder. A lineage mystery centers the fine folkloric title tale, though digressive genealogies obfuscate and confuse minor and major characters elsewhere. These investigations are stitched with information culled from diverse sources: interviews, an encyclopedia, state archives, diary entries, photographs and letters. Krall's (<i>Shielding the Flame</i>, etc.) prose is compressed, unadorned and journalistic. Braiding history with imagination, she produces necessary accounts that incisively unveil and interrogate the ruptured historical legacy of Jews after WWII. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There wasn't much work, so I made some sample pictures and took them to several publishers. They all rejected my work. But one editor suggested that I try writing a book of my own to illustrate. I had done a painting of a little girl with a big red dog. That seemed like a funny idea, so I made up a story about them. I increased the dog's size from as big as a horse to as big as a house. My wife named the dog Clifford, and we named the little girl Emily Elizabeth after our daughter. In three days I had written the story and drawn the pictures for Clifford The Big Red Dog.

His evocations of commonplace subjects have earned him a reputation as a Pop artist, while his interest in language and typography has aligned him with Conceptual art. This book, published to accompany Ruscha's first museum retrospective of drawings, showcases his singular vision and his wide range of highly personal mediums and techniques-from pastels and gunpowder to blood, coffee, and tobacco stains. <p>Ruscha's work includes paintings, photographs, prints, books, and films, but his unique works on paper are perhaps his richest vein. Through his interpretations of cultural icons and vernacular subjects such as the Hollywood sign, trademarks, and gas stations, as well as his renderings of words and phrases in countless stylistic variations, Ruscha proposes a modern landscape based on keen observation and wry humor.</p></p><p>In a 1976 drawing by Ed Ruscha, the word "Promise"&#x2014;--spelled out in ribbon-like script&#x2014;--is suspended at an oblique angle against a delicate gray background and bathed in a gauzy white light. Somehow, this image perfectly sums up the hopeful feeling that success is right around the corner. Ruscha's ability to give concrete form to the inner life of words and images from popular culture has made him a rare breed of artist---a critic's darling whose work also fascinates ordinary art lovers. <i>Cotton Puffs, Q-Tips�, Smoke and Mirrors: The Drawings of Ed Ruscha</i> collects more than 200 of Ruscha's coolly mysterious works on paper in a handsomely designed volume marred only by a hard-to-read gray typeface. The odd title comes from a remark the artist once made. He uses cotton puffs and swabs to rub gunpowder (which creates those smoky grays) or pastel into the rag paper. Author Margit Rowell emphasizes the influence of photography and film on Ruscha's visual outlook---as well as his training in graphic design and the Los Angeles "landscape" of billboards glimpsed from car windows. Rucha, who is also known for his paintings and his idiosyncratic photo books (depicting serial images of gas stations, parking lots and other banal sights), has been working on paper since the late 1950s. Rowell tracks the various themes and styles of his drawings, while essayist Cornelia Butler adds additional art world context. Although Ruscha has been called a Pop artist and a West Coast Surrealist, Butler sees him as "an essentially Conceptualist artist who seeks to render ideas as information." She singles out his "deeply eccentric nihilism...filtered through a keen humor." This book accompanies an exhibition of Ruscha's work on paper organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (June 24&#x2013;Sept. 26, 2004). <i>-&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i>Margit Rowell has been a curator at the Solomon R.

Several of the pieces are set in the South, and their pacing is infused with the slowness of a Southern drawl. The mastery of the author's storytelling lies in his ability to create atmosphere. His characters are defined by the mood of the world around them, a world that is often confining and in which hope is thrown aside in favor of a grim pragmatism. Lehane populates his stories with people who are ordinary and reveals the extraordinary complexity of their lives. The decisions they face are unenviable and their choices somehow unavoidable. The author invents nuanced relationships in which murder and betrayal become acts of loyalty and friendship. Each story introduces a touch of the unlikely or unfortunate into otherwise mundane circumstances, then relays the consequences as events unfold. Haunting imagery lingers long after the book is closed.<i>&#x2013;Heidi Dolamore, San Mateo County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Among the topics addressed are: Do Facebook and Google constitute &#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;the greatest surveillance machine that ever existed,&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34; perpetually tracking people&#39;s locations, contacts and lives? Far from being victims of that surveillance, are most people willing collaborators? Are there legitimate forms of surveillance? And does anyone have the ability to resist this tide?</p><p><b>Julian Assange</b> is the editor in chief of WikiLeaks. An original contributor to the cypherpunk mailing list, Assange is the author of numerous software projects in line with the cypherpunk philosophy, including the Rubberhose encryption system and the original code for WikiLeaks.

Montalbano&#39;s passion to solve this old crime takes him, heedless of personal danger, on a journey through the island&#39;s past and into a family&#39;s dark heart amid the horrors of World War II. Andrea Camilleri&#39;s Inspector Salvo Montalbano has garnered millions of fans worldwide with his sardonic, engaging take on Sicilian small-town life and his genius for deciphering the most enigmatic of crimes. &#39;The novels of Andrea Camilleri breath out the sense of place, the sense of humour, and the sense of despair that fill the air of Sicily. To read him is to be taken to that glorious, tortured island&#39; Donna Leon &#39;Both farcical and endearing, Montalbano is a cross between Columbo and Chandler&#39;s Philip Marlowe, with the added culinary idiosyncrasies of an Italian Maigret&#39; Guardian</p><p>Andrea Camilleri is one of Italy&#39;s most famous contemporary writers. His books have sold over 65 million copies worldwide. He lives in Rome. The Inspector Montalbano series, which began with The Shape of Water, has been translated into thirty-two languages and was adapted for Italian television, screened on BBC4. The Potter&#39;s Field, the thirteenth book in the series, was awarded the Crime Writers&#39; Association&#39;s International Dagger for the best crime novel translated into English. In addition to his phenomenally successful Inspector Montalbano series, he is also the author of the historical comic mysteries Hunting Season and The Brewer of Preston.<p>To judge from the entrance the dawn was making, it promised to be a very iffy day&#x2014;that is, blasts of angry sunlight one minute, fits of freezing rain the next, all of it seasoned with sudden gusts of wind&#x2014;one of those days when someone who is sensitive to abrupt shifts in weather and suffers them in his blood and brain is likely to change opinion and direction continuously, like those sheets of tin, cut in the shape of banners and roosters, that spin every which way on rooftops with each new puff of wind.</p> <p>Inspector Salvo Montalbano had always belonged to this unhappy category of humanity. It was something passed on to him by his mother, a sickly woman who used to shut herself up in her bedroom, in the dark, whenever she had a headache, and when this happened one could make no noise about the house and had to tread lightly. His father, on the other hand, on stormy seas and smooth, always maintained an even keel, always the same unchanging state of mind, rain or shine.</p> <p>This time, too, the inspector did not fail to live up to his inborn nature. No sooner had he stopped his car at the ten-kilometer marker along the Vig�ta-Fela highway, as he had been told to do, than he felt like putting it back in gear and returning to town, bagging the whole operation. He managed to control himself, brought the car closer to the edge of the road, opened the glove compartment, and reached for the pistol he normally did not carry on his person. His hand, however, remained poised in midair: immobile, spellbound, he stared at the weapon.</p> <p>Good God! It's real! he thought.</p> <p>The previous evening, a few hours before Geg� Gullotta called to set up the whole mess-Geg� being a small-time dealer of soft drugs and the manager of an open-air bordello known as "the Pasture"-the inspector had been reading a detective novel by a writer from Barcelona who greatly intrigued him and had the same surname as he, though hispanicized: Montalb�n. One sentence in particular had struck him: "The pistol slept, looking like a cold lizard." He withdrew his hand with a slight feeling of disgust and closed the glove compartment, leaving the lizard to its slumber. After all, if the whole business that was about to unfold turned out to be a trap, an ambush, he could carry all the pistols he wanted, and still they would fill him with holes with their Kalishnikovs however and whenever they so desired, thank you and good night. He could only hope that Geg�, remembering the years they'd spent together on the same bench in elementary school and the friendship they'd carried over into adulthood, had not decided, out of self-interest, to sell him like pork at the market, feeding him any old bullshit just to lead him to the slaughter. No, not just any old bullshit: this business, if for real, could be really big, make a lot of noise.</p> <p>He sighed deeply and began to make his way slowly, step by step, up a narrow, rocky path between broad expanses of vineyard. The vines bore table grapes, with round, firm seeds, the kind called, who knows why, "Italian grapes," the only kind that would take in this soil. As for trying to grow vines for making wine, in this soil you were better off sparing yourself the labor and expense.</p> <p>The two-story cottage, one room on top of another, was at the summit of the hill, half-hidden by four large Saracen olive trees that nearly surrounded it. It was just as Geg� had described it. Faded, shuttered windows and door, a huge caper bush in front, with some smaller shrubs of touch-me-not-the small, wild cucumber that squirts seeds into the air if you touch it with the tip of a stick-a collapsed wicker chair turned upside down, an old zinc bucket eaten up by rust and now useless. Grass had overgrown everything else. It all conspired to give the impression that the place had been uninhabited for years, but this appearance was deceptive, and experience had made Montalbano too savvy to be fooled. In fact he was convinced that somebody was eyeing him from inside the cottage, trying to guess his intentions from the moves he would make. He stopped three steps in front of the house, took off his jacket, and hung it from a branch of the olive tree so they could see he wasn't armed. Then he called out without raising his voice much, like a friend come to visit a friend.</p> <p>"Hey! Anybody home?"</p> <p>No answer, not a sound. Montalbano pulled a lighter and a pack of cigarettes from his trouser pocket, put one in his mouth, and lit it, turning round halfway to shelter himself from the wind. That way whoever was inside the house could examine him from behind, having already examined him from the front. He took two puffs, then went to the door and knocked with his fist, hard enough to hurt his knuckles on the crusts of paint on the wood.</p> <p>"Is there anyone here?" he asked again.</p> <p>He was ready for anything, except the calm, ironic voice that surprised him from behind.</p> <p>"Sure there is. Over here."</p> <p>*</p> <p>It had all started with a phone call.</p> <p>"Hello? Hello? Montalbano! Salvuzzo! It's me, Geg�."</p> <p>"I know it's you. Calm down. How are you, my little honey-eyed orange blossom?"</p> <p>"I'm fine."</p> <p>"Working the mouth hard these days? Been perfecting your blow-job techniques?"</p> <p>"Come on, Salv�, don't start with your usual faggot stuff. You know damn well that I don't work myself. I only make other mouths work for me."</p> <p>"But aren't you the instructor? Aren't you the one who teaches your multicolored assortment of whores how to hold their lips and how hard to suck?"</p> <p>"Salv�, even if what you're saying was true, they'd be the ones teaching me. They come to me at age ten already well-trained, and at fifteen they're top-of-the-line professionals. I've got a little Albanian fourteen-year-old-"</p> <p>"You trying to sell me your merchandise now?"</p> <p>"Listen, I got no time to fuck around. I have something I'm supposed to give you, a package."</p> <p>"At this hour? Can't you get it to me tomorrow morning?"</p> <p>"I won't be in town tomorrow."</p> <p>"Do you know what's in the package?"</p> <p>"Of course. Mostaccioli with mulled wine, the way you like 'em. My sister Mariannina made them just for you."</p> <p>"How's Mariannina doing with her eyes?"</p> <p>"Much better. They work miracles in Barcelona."</p> <p>"They also write good books in Barcelona."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Never mind. Just talking to myself. Where do you want to meet?"</p> <p>"The usual place, in an hour."</p> <p>*</p> <p>The usual place was the little beach of Puntasecca, a short tongue of sand beneath a white marl hill, almost inaccessible by land, or rather, accessible only to Montalbano and Geg�, who back in grade school had discovered a trail that was difficult enough on foot and downright foolhardy to attempt by car. Puntasecca was only a few kilometers from Montalbano's little house by the sea just outside of Vig�ta, and that was why he took his time. But the moment he opened the door to go to his rendezvous, the telephone rang.</p> <p>"Hi, darling. It's me, right on time. How did things go today?"</p> <p>"Business as usual. And you?"</p> <p>"Ditto. Listen, Salvo, I've been thinking long and hard about what-"</p> <p>"Livia, sorry to interrupt, but I haven't got much time. Actually I don't have any time at all. You caught me just as I was going out the door."</p> <p>"All right then, good night."</p> <p>Livia hung up and Montalbano was left standing with the receiver in his hand. Then he remembered that the night before, he had told her to call him at midnight on the dot, because they would certainly have as much time as they wanted to talk at that hour. He couldn't decide whether to call Livia back right then or when he returned, after his meeting with Geg�. With a pang of remorse, he put the receiver down and went out.</p> <p>*</p> <p>When he arrived a few minutes late, Geg� was already waiting for him, pacing back and forth the length of his car. They exchanged an embrace and kissed; it had been a while since they'd seen each other.</p> <p>"Let's go sit in my car," said the inspector, "it's a little chilly tonight."</p> <p>"They put me up to this," Geg� broke in as soon as he sat down.</p> <p>"Who did?"</p> <p>"Some people I can't say no to. You know, Salv�, like every businessman, I gotta pay my dues so I can work in peace and keep the Pasture, or they'd put me out to pasture in a hurry. Every month the good Lord sends our way, somebody comes by to collect."</p> <p>"For whom? Can you tell me?"</p> <p>"For Tano the Greek."</p> <p>Montalbano shuddered, but didn't let his friend notice. Gaetano "the Greek" Bennici had never so much as seen Greece, not even through a telescope, and knew as much about things Hellenic as a cast-iron pipe, but he came by his nickname owing to a certain vice thought in the popular imagination to be greatly appreciated in the vicinity of the Acropolis. He had three certain murders under his belt, and in his circles held a position one step below the top bosses. But he was not known to operate in or around Vig�ta; it was the Cuffaro and Sinagra families who competed for that territory. Tano belonged to another parish.</p> <p>"So what's Tano the Greek's business in these parts?"</p> <p>"What kind of stupid question is that? What kind of fucking cop are you? Don't you know that for Tano the Greek there's no such thing as 'these parts' and 'those parts' when it comes to women? He was given control and a piece of every whore on the island."</p> <p>"I didn't know. Go on."</p> <p>"Around eight o'clock this evening the usual guy came by to collect; today was the appointed day for paying dues. He took the money, but then, instead of leaving, he opens his car door and tells me to get in."</p> <p>"So what'd you do?"</p> <p>"I got scared and broke out in a cold sweat. What could I do? I got in, and we drove off. To make a long story short, he took the road for Fela, and stopped after barely half an hour's drive . . ."</p> <p>"Did you ask him where you were going?"</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"And what did he say?"</p> <p>"Nothing, as if I hadn't spoken. After half an hour, he makes me get out in some deserted spot without a soul around, and gestures to me to follow some dirt road. There wasn't even a dog around. At a certain point, and I have no idea where he popped out of, Tano the Greek suddenly appears in front of me. I nearly had a stroke, my knees turned to butter. Don't get me wrong, I'm no coward, but the guy's killed five people."</p> <p>"Five?"</p> <p>"Why, how many do you think he's killed?"</p> <p>"Three."</p> <p>"No way, it's five, I guarantee it."</p> <p>"Okay, go on."</p> <p>"I got to thinking. Since I always pay on time, I figured Tano wanted to raise the price. Business is good, I got no complaints, and they know it. But I was wrong, it wasn't about money."</p> <p>"What did he want?"</p> <p>"Without even saying hello, he asked me if I knew you."</p> <p>Montalbano thought he hadn't heard right.</p> <p>"If you knew who?"</p> <p>"You, Salv�, you."</p> <p>"And what did you tell him?"</p> <p>"Well, I was shitting my pants, so I said, yeah, I knew you, but just casually, by sight-you know, hello, how ya doin'. And he looked at me, you gotta believe me, with a pair of eyes that looked like a statue's eyes, motionless, dead, then he leaned his head back and gave this little laugh and asked me if I wanted to know how many hairs I had on my ass 'cause he could tell me within two. What he meant was that he knew everything about me from the cradle to the grave, and I hope that won't be too soon. And so I just looked at the ground and didn't open my mouth. That's when he told me he wanted to see you."</p> <p>"When and where?"</p> <p>"Tonight, at dawn. I'll tell you where in a second."</p> <p>"Do you know what he wants from me?"</p> <p>"I don't know and I don't want to know. He said to rest assured you could trust him like a brother."</p> <p>Like a brother. Those words, instead of reassuring Montalbano, sent a shiver down his spine. It was well-known that foremost among Tano's three-or five-murder victims was his older brother Nicolino, whom he first strangled and then, in accordance with some mysterious semiological rule, meticulously flayed. The inspector started thinking dark thoughts, which became even darker, if that was possible, at the words that Geg�, putting his hand on his shoulder, then whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"Be careful, Salv�, the guy's an evil beast."</p> <p>&#x2014;Reprinted from <b>The&nbsp;Terra-Cotta Dog</b>&nbsp;by Andrea Camilleri by permission of Penguin Books, a member of Penguin&nbsp;Group (USA)&nbsp;Inc.

The story of John Law's life and legacy is nothing short of incredible, breath-catching drama.<p> Born into a Scottish family of Church clerics and goldsmiths in 1671, John Law grew up to exude little of the moral and much of the monetary influence in his blood. When, as a 23-year-old gambler and philandering playboy on the London scene, he killed a nobleman in a duel, he was thrown into prison and sentenced to death. After pursing legal channels of appeal and getting nowhere, he eventually escaped and began the life of a gambler-cum-aristocrat in exile. His uncanny knack at the card tables and renowned success with women earned him a dubious reputation within late seventeenth-century European social circles. But his equally outstanding mathematical skills and fascination with the mechanisms of credit also brought him to the attention of political leaders. After attempting to peddle his revolutionary scheme for creating a national bank that issued paper currency to officials in London, Scotland, Vienna, Turin, and elsewhere, Law finally convinced the war-impoverished French government to back his plan. The bank's success and the events that followed--Law's introduction of the "Mississippi scheme," a wild exercise in capital procurement and share offering that spawned the greatest bull market in history and its drastic crash--make this book fascinating reading for anyone playing the markets today. </p><p> Gleeson writes with clarity and style on topics that are notoriously complex and potentially dry. Without dumbing down her subject matter, she elucidates the finer points of credit-based financial systems and stock markets in readable English, welcoming both finance aficionados and illiterates to Law's tale. In that regard, the book is similar to Simon Winchester's <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>, and though ostensibly a record of the rise and fall of one of the world's most infamous--and ultimately influential--financiers, it is a story of murder, lust, politics, wealth, and poverty and far more intriguing than most fare in its often prosaic category. Indeed, this book will leap off your business bookshelf faster than you can ask who wants to be a millionaire. --<i>S.

No mere theorist, Baker purchased the only surviving complete set of the Sunday <i>World,</i> Joseph Pulitzer's phenomenally popular New York City newspaper, and now he and his wife, reporter Brentano, present some of the jewels of their precious collection in a beautifully produced and endlessly fascinating volume that celebrates the ingenuity and verve of the <i>World</i> and turn-of-the-twentieth-century popular graphic art. Judiciously selected pages feature intriguing headlines, articles, and advertisements, and, most spectacularly, showcase clever, zany, marvelously kinetic, even elegant illustrations, political cartoons, and comics. Seeking to seduce and secure readers, the <i>World</i> offers exclusives by Mark Twain and Arctic explorer Robert Peary; colorful tributes to such technological wonders as electric lights on Broadway, the subway, skyscrapers, and battleships; and striking images of the great tide of immigrants arriving on Ellis Island.

They are hardly vigilantes, but each is determined to live according to his own personal ideals and desires&#x2015;which means forcibly rising above the pettiness of their surroundings. <i>The Discreet Hero</i> is also a chance to revisit some of our favorite players from previous Vargas Llosa novels: Sergeant Lituma, Don Rigoberto, Do�a Lucrecia, and Fonchito are all here in a prosperous Peru. Vargas Llosa sketches Piura and Lima vividly&#x2015;and the cities become not merely physical spaces but realms of the imagination populated by his vivid characters.<br> A novel whose humor and pathos shine through in Edith Grossman's masterly translation, <i>The Discreet Hero</i> is another remarkable achievement from the finest Latin American novelist at work today.</p></p><p><p><b>Mario Vargas Llosa</b> was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010 "for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat." He has been awarded the Cervantes Prize, the Spanish-speaking world's most distinguished literary honor. His many works include <i>The Feast of the Goat</i>, <i>The Bad Girl</i>, and <i>Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</i>. <br> One of our most celebrated translators of literature in Spanish, <b>Edith Grossman</b> has translated the works of the Nobel laureates Mario Vargas Llosa and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, among others.

But what technique is needed! While real television soap operas are shaggy and plodding, Vargas Llosa's novel is swift, seamless and as structurally symmetrical as a diamond.&#x201d; &#x2015;Marcela Valdes, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Discreet Hero</i>, [is] an energetic book with a more straightforward narrative method than almost any other Vargas Llosa . . . [the book] is most memorable for its optimism . . . and for the way in which Don Rigoberto is forced away from his etchings and phonograph records and into the 'sordid warp and woof' of the world he has scorned.&#x201d; &#x2015;Thomas Mallon, <i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;The book is often funny; you turn the pages with relish; it offers plenty to think about and admire . . . it immerses you in the way you hope any novel will immerse you.&#x201d; &#x2015;Francisco Goldman, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Irresistible . . .

A first novel. 22,000 first printing.</p><p>Vianne Rocher and her 6-year-old daughter, Anouk, arrive in the small village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes--"a blip on the fast road between Toulouse and Bourdeaux"--in February, during the carnival. Three days later, Vianne opens a luxuriant chocolate shop crammed with the most tempting of confections and offering a mouth-watering variety of hot chocolate drinks. It's Lent, the shop is opposite the church and open on Sundays, and Francis Reynaud, the austere parish priest, is livid. <p> One by one the locals succumb to Vianne's concoctions. Joanne Harris weaves their secrets and troubles, their loves and desires, into her third novel, with the lightest touch. There's sad, polite Guillame and his dying dog; thieving, beaten-up Jos�phine Muscat; schoolchildren who declare it "hypercool" when Vianne says they can help eat the window display--a gingerbread house complete with witch. And there's Armande, still vigorous in her 80s, who can see Anouk's "imaginary" rabbit, Pantoufle, and recognizes Vianne for who she really is. However, certain villagers--including Armande's snobby daughter and Jos�phine's violent husband--side with Reynaud. So when Vianne announces a Grand Festival of Chocolate commencing Easter Sunday, it's all-out war: war between church and chocolate, between good and evil, between love and dogma. </p><p> Reminiscent of Herman Hesse's short story "Augustus," <i>Chocolat</i> is an utterly delicious novel, coated in the gentlest of magic, which proves--indisputably and without preaching--that soft centers are best. <i>--Lisa Gee, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>When the exotic stranger Vianne Rocher arrives in the old French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique called ?La Celeste Praline? directly across the square from the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock. It is the beginning of Lent: the traditional season of self-denial. The priest says she?ll be out of business by Easter. <br> <br>To make matters worse, Vianne does not go to church and has a penchant for superstition. Like her mother, she can read Tarot cards. But she begins to win over customers with her smiles, her intuition for everyone?s favourites, and her delightful confections. Her shop provides a place, too, for secrets to be whispered, grievances aired. She begins to shake up the rigid morality of the community. Vianne?s plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community. Can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate �clair? <br> <br>For the first time, here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as an agent of transformation. Rich, clever, and mischievous, reminiscent of a folk tale or fable, this is a triumphant read with a memorable character at its heart. <br> <br>Says Harris: ?You might see [Vianne] as an archetype or a mythical figure. I prefer to see her as the lone gunslinger who blows into the town, has a showdown with the man in the black hat, then moves on relentless. But on another level she is a perfectly real person with real insecurities and a very human desire for love and acceptance. Her qualities too ? kindness, love, tolerance ? are very human.? Vianne and her young daughter Anouk, come into town on Shrove Tuesday. ?Carnivals make us uneasy,? says Harris, ?because of what they represent: the residual memory of blood sacrifice (it is after all from the word "carne" that the term arises), of pagan celebration. And they represent a loss of inhibition; carnival time is a time at which almost anything is possible.? <br> <br>The book became an international best-seller, and was optioned to film quickly. The Oscar-nominated movie, with its star-studded cast including Juliette Binoche ( <i>The English Patient</i>) and Judi Dench ( <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>), was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose previous film <i>The Cider House Rules</i> (based on a John Irving novel) also looks at issues of community and moral standards, though in a less lighthearted vein. <br> <br>The idea for the book came from a comment her husband made one day while he was immersed in a football game on TV. ?It was a throwaway comment, designed to annoy and it did. It was along the lines of... <i>Chocolate is to women what football is to men?</i>? The idea stuck, and Harris began thinking that ?people have these conflicting feelings about chocolate, and that a lot of people who have very little else in common relate to chocolate in more or less the same kind of way. It became a kind of challenge to see exactly how much of a story I could get which was uniquely centred around chocolate.? <br> <br> <b>Other Books<br><br></b> <i>Five Quarters of the Orange<br>Blackberry Wine<br><br>Sleep, Pale Sister<br>The Evil Seed<br></i> <b><br><br>Suggested Reading<br><br></b>John Allemang <i>The Importance of Lunch<br></i>Peter Mayle <i>A Year in Provence</i>; <i>Encore Provence<br></i>Patrick S�skind <i>Perfume</i> <br>Jeannette Winterson <i>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit<br></i></p><h2>Disobedience: A Novel</h2><p>Learning that her orthodox Jewish rabbi father has passed away, Manhattan single woman Ronit Krushka returns to the home she fled years earlier and reconnects with a beloved cousin and a forbidden childhood sweetheart, only to become a threat to her former community. A first novel. 30,000 first printing.</p><p><i>Disobedience</i> is Naomi Alderman's richly told, endearingly evocative tale of two women and the choices they make as they come to terms with their identities in a traditional Orthodox Jewish community. In this groundbreaking debut, Alderman puts her characters to work, forcing them to confront issues of rebellion, isolation, loneliness and self-acceptance in a place where deviating from the norm often results in cold stares and hushed whispers at the kosher butcher shop. <p> Ronit Krushka is a lapsed Orthodox Jew, who fled the confines of Hendon, England, and her traditional upbringing for a secular lifestyle on Manhattan's Upper West Side. When her father, the community's revered Rabbi passes away, Ronit returns home to retrieve her mother's precious Shabbat candlesticks, and to revisit her troubled past. She reconnects with Esti, a former lover, whose choices have left her unsure and unfulfilled. As Ronit and Esti navigate through the demons of their past, each woman is forced to decide what kind of life she wants to lead, and with whom she wants to share it. </p><p> Alderman alternates between a lyrical and familiar style, introducing each chapter with a page of religious commentary that relates directly to the novel. While the commentary is interesting, readers may find themselves skimming it as the plot thickens and these introductions become more like diversions from the story's main message. Still, interruptions aside, <i>Disobedience</i> marks an important debut, and one that extends outside the lives of these characters to personify the struggle between conformity and individualism for everyone who has felt like an outsider. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><b>Naomi Alderman</b> is a graduate of Oxford University and the University of East Anglia's Creative Writing MA and has published award-winning short fiction in a number of anthologies.

Suddenly, Alexa is involved in a battle much, much larger than her own life . . . a battle in which she is destined to play a key role. In order to help good defeat evil, Alexa and her friends must venture farther than they've ever gone before -- confronting giants, bats, ravenous dogs, and a particularly ghoulish mastermind in order to bring back peace.</p><p>Patrick Carman is the bestselling author of numerous series for young readers, including The Land of Elyon, Elliot&#x2019;s Park, Skeleton Creek, Atherton, Trackers, Dark Eden, and 3:15. He got his start as a storyteller weaving bedtime tales for his two daughters. He lives in Walla Walla, Washington, with his family.Sometimes it makes sense to go back to the first book in a series, rather than start in the middle. In this series for young adults, Alexa and her friends have faced evil before and prevailed. In this book, in which they face new dangers, having read the earlier work provides definite advantages. Aasne Vigesaa brings a sense of adventure and enthusiasm to her narration. She keeps the tone light and upbeat even when the odds facing these young adventurers seem overwhelming. A variety of accents and cadence helps differentiate her characters. Vigesaa draws out the drama and suspense of the plot and keeps the story at a strong pace.

Christian Ford is a man who is betrayed in an adulterous affair, only to discover that he himself betrayed a woman he loved and abandoned. Throughout the story, Christian attempts to understand the dangerously paradoxical nature of human relations and to show that adultery extends beyond mere physical infidelity.</p><p>Christian Ford is an artist who teaches at a New England prep school; Farol Colorado is a beautiful young woman who works at an art gallery in town. When the two begin their affair, he has an "understanding" with another woman, and Farol is married to her second husband. Theroux's third novel, after Three Wogs and Darconville's Cat, describes the rising and falling phases of their relationship in great psychological detail, focusing on Farol's, and also Ford's, inconstancy. Told from Ford's point of viewin a remote and superior tonethe story remains true to its narrator's shifting passions. Guilt, passion and will are topics for Theroux's intelligent, unstinting analysis, raising suggestions of earlier chroniclers of love in the works of Nabokov and Flaubert. But the questions of whether Farol will leave her husband, of how truthful she is about the rest of her life (and how reliable an observer Ford is) are slight fare for so extensive an examination. In the end, the obsessive narration and dearth of dialogue make for a reading experience as dry and remote as Ford's experience of love. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Christian Ford, a moderately successful painter wasting away in New Hampshire, begins dating a sad young woman named Farol Colorado. She tells him that she is about to divorce her husband, is in group therapy, and is slowly dying of multiple sclerosis. Ford falls hopelessly in love, but as his obsession grows, so too does his annoyance with Farol's superficiality, hypochondria, vindictiveness, and inability to break with her husband. Manic devotion to an undeserving woman is a favorite theme in works of writers from Benjamin Constant to Nabokov. Theroux, best known for the logorrheic extravaganza Darconville's Cat ( LJ 6/1/81), gives us a disturbing, misogynistic novel that invites comparison with such classics. For all fiction collections.

Brothers David and Mark Shannon have preserved one such tale that dates back to the France of the Middle Ages: the winsome folk story of the legendary Acrobat of God.<p> Young P�quel� ("PAY-kul-lay") is separated from his parents as a baby when his village falls to the plague. His mother weaves an angel from twigs and dried flowers and tucks it into P�quel�'s blanket to protect him as he goes to live with his grandmother in the mountains. P�quel� proves to be a vibrant, joyful boy, earning money for his grandmother with juggling and acrobatics in the village square. Every night, the two pray before P�quel�'s angel, giving thanks for each other and "the warmth and light" inside them, "all simple folks like ourselves can understand of God's mysterious ways." But when P�quel�'s grandmother passes away, he must find a new home yet again. Rescued by sweet Friar John, P�quel� reluctantly abandons his acrobat ways for life with the monks--but his gift, his leaping, spinning repertoire of tricks, turns out to be just the miracle the monastery needs.</p><p> Thoughtfully written by Mark Shannon and energetically illustrated by his brother David Shannon (of Caldecott Honor Book <i>No, David!</i>), this touching tale makes a warm, winning choice for story hour.

The result is a vital portrait of one of the most remarkable men of any age as well as a revealing depiction of a man of extraordinary courage and imagination.</p></p><p>It is impossible to understand the Second World War without understanding Winston Churchill, the bold British Prime Minister who showed himself to be one of the greatest statesmen any nation has ever known. This lengthy biography is a single-volume abridgment of a massive, eight-volume work that took a quarter-century to write. It covers Churchill&#39;s entire life, highlighting not only his exploits during the Second World War, but also his early belief in technology and how it would revolutionize warfare in the 20th century. Churchill learned how to fly a plane before the First World War, and was also involved in the development of both the tank and anti-aircraft defense. But he truly showed his unmatched mettle during his country&#39;s darkest moments: &#34;His finest hour was the leadership of Britain when it was most isolated, most threatened, and most weak; when his own courage, determination, and belief in democracy became at one with the nation,&#34; writes Gilbert. There are several wonderful books available on Churchill, but this is probably the best place to start.Martin Gilbert&#39;s highly-acclaimed &#34;Churchill: A Life is a story of adventure. It follows Winston Churchill from his earliest days to his moments of triumph. Here, the drama and excitement of his story are ever-present, as are his tremendous qualities in peace and war, not least as an orator and as a man of vision. Gilbert gives us a vivid portrait, using Churchill&#39;s most personal letters and the recollections of his contemporaries, both friends and enemies, to go behind the scenes of some of the stormiest and most fascinating political events of our time, dominated by two world wars and culminating in the era of the Iron Curtain.</p><h2>100 Amazing Paper Animal Snowflakes: A Magical Menagerie of Kirigami Templates to Copy, Fold, and Cut--Includes 8 Preprinted Color Templates</h2><p><p><strong>Create endless animal themed snowflakes with the unique and imaginative templates that crafters and artists will love!</strong></p><p>Let it snow... animals!

A new nation&#x2015;born in revolution, divided over the nature of republicanism, undermined by deep-seated sectional allegiances, and mired in foreign policy entanglements&#x2015;faced the challenge of creating a stable, enduring national authority and union.<br><br>In this engagingly written book, James Roger Sharp offers a penetrating new assessment disputing the conventional wisdom that the birth of the country was a relatively painless and unexceptional one. Instead, he tells the dramatic story of how the euphoria surrounding the inauguration of George Washington as the country's first president quickly soured. Soon, the Federalist defenders of the administration and their Republican critics regarded each other as bitter political enemies. The intense partisanship prevented the acceptance of the idea that an opposition could both oppose and be loyal to the government. As a result, the nation teetered on the brink of disintegration as fear, insurrection, and threats of secession abounded. Many even envisioned armed civil conflict as a possible outcome.<br><br>Despite the polarization, the nation did manage to survive its first trial. The election of Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and the nonviolent transfer of power from one political group to another ended the immediate crisis. But sectionally based politics continued to plague the nation and eventually led to the Civil War.<br></p><p><b>James Roger Sharp</b> is professor of history at Syracuse University.&nbsp;</p><h2>Beyond Training: Mastering Endurance, Health &amp; Life</h2><p><b>Whether you're an extreme exercise enthusiast or you're just looking to shed&nbsp;<br> a few pounds, this is the last book on training, endurance, health, and&nbsp;<br> life you will ever need.</b><br><br><b>In this book you will learn:</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The 2 best ways to build fitness fast without destroying your body<br> <br> Underground training tactics for maximizing workout efficiency<br> <br> The best biohacks for enhancing mental performance and entering the zone<br> <br> How to know with laserlike accuracy whether your body has truly recovered<br> <br> 26 ways to recover quickly from workouts, injuries, and overtraining<br> <br> The 25 most important blood and saliva biomarkers and how to test them<br> <br> 5 essential elements of training that most athletes neglect<br> <br> 7 stress-fighting weapons to make your mind-body connection bulletproof<br> <br> Proven systems to enhance sleep, eliminate insomnia, and conquer jet lag<br> <br> 40 high-calorie, nutrient-dense meals that won't destroy your metabolism<br> <br> Easy tools for customizing your carbs, proteins, and fats for your unique body<br> <br> 9 ways to fix a broken gut, detox your body, and create a toxin-free life<br> <br> A complete system to safeguard your immune system and stomach<br> &nbsp;<br> Simple time-efficiency tips for balancing training, work, travel, and family<br> <br> &nbsp;</p><p>Ben Greenfield is a coach, author, speaker, ex-bodybuilder, and Ironman triathlete.

Jack Whalen, a former L.A. cop, is pursuing a new career as a writer in an idyllic small town just east of Seattle when weird things start to undermine his pursuit of the American dream. First, an old acquaintance from Jack's childhood suddenly turns up with a strange tale about a double homicide; then Jack's wife, an advertising executive, disappears briefly on a business trip. Is he going crazy, or is she leading some sort of secret life? And what about these disturbing spells he keeps having, these fleeting sensations of otherness, in which his own existence is unfamiliar to him? Meanwhile, down the coast in Portland, a nine-year-old girl having similar visions has gone missing. As Jack investigates, he stumbles onto a secret much darker than he ever could have anticipated. Marshall ingeniously threads these strands together into a provocative and supremely intelligent thriller that reads like a cross between Andrew Klavan and Philip K. Dick. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As in his Twelve Days of Christmas (Macmillan, 1981), Knight extends the meaning of the grouped poems with accompanying scenes that create their own subtext. The book is arranged by seasons . Hopkins shows the strength of a true master collector. His selections embrace Mother Goose, traditional songs, and modern poets such as Eve Merriam, Langston Hughes, and Robert Louis Stevenson. A book worthy to sit side by side with Prelutsky's Read-Aloud Rhymes for the Very Young (Knopf, 1986) and some of Hopkins' other collections.

True to the title, the poems collected are perfect for reading side by side. There are story poems; counting rhymes; verses about seasons, holidays and animals. Every page is filled with Knight's rollicking watercolors of exuberant, bright-eyed children. What will ensure this book's popularity, however, is the inclusion of poems many parents and grandparents will remember, including "A Visit from St. Nicholas," "The Three Little Kittens" and "The House that Jack Built."

Whether you're constructing a wall, redesigning a garden, or adding paving, your structure will blend in naturally with its surroundings. As you accomplish a range of projects using dry-laid and mortared techniques, as well as decorative ones like carving, you'll find out how versatile working with stone is and that you can use fewer and simpler tools than with any other material and achieve spectacular results. You'll be surprised and pleased with the spectacular results you can achieve with a few simple tools and the natural beauty of stone.<br>Stone is one of the most beautiful and enduring building materials, and to exploit its qualities one must be aware of a number of specialized techniques. Both Pleasant's and Reed's offerings will allow readers to use stone as a creative material outdoors. These titles are in some ways very similar, showing readers a variety of techniques used to shape and place stones in their yards and providing ideas for creating paths and walls. They diverge in approach and depth Pleasant's title places a greater emphasis on gardening and landscaping details such as plant selection, while Reed's provides much more information on actually building things (and, as one might guess, building with stone is a lot of work). Both titles are well written and beautifully illustrated throughout. Larger collections will want both of these wonderful books, but if libraries are forced to choose only one, then Pleasant's gets the nod because of its wider appeal to both gardeners and builders. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Age Of Reason</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos, missing text, images, or index.

It has often been said that any thing may be proved from the Bible; but before any thing can be admitted as proved by Bible, the Bible itself must be proved to be true; for if the Bible be not true, or the truth of it be doubtful, it ceases to have authority, and cannot be admitted as proof of any thing. It has been the practice of all Christian commentators on the Bible, and of all Christian priests and preachers, to impose the Bible on the world as a mass of truth, and as the word of God ; they have disputed and wrangled, and have anathematized each other about the supposeable meaning of particular parts and passages therein; one has said and insisted that such a passage meant such a thing, another that it meant directly the contrary, and a third, that it meant neither one nor the other, but something different from both; and this they have called understanding the Bible. It has happened, that all the answers that I have seen to the former part of The Age of Reason have been written by priests: and these pious men, like their predecessors, contend and wrangle, and understand the Bible; each understands it differently, but each understands it best; and they have agreed in nothing but in telling their readers that Thomas Paine understands it not. Now instead of wasting their time, and heating themselves in fractious disputations about doctrinal points drawn from the Bible, these men ought to know, and if they do not it is civility to inform them, that the first thing to be understood is, whether there is sufficient authority for believing the Bible to be the word of God, or whether there is not? There are matters in that book, said to be done by the express command of God, that are as shocking to humanity, and to every idea we have of...</p><p>COSIMO CLASSICS offers distinctive titles by the great authors and thinkers who have inspired, informed and engaged readers throughout the ages.THOMAS PAINE (1737-1809) was an Anglo-American political theorist and writer born in Norfolk, England.

At the church where she volunteers as music director, Sophia tries to forget her cares as she leads the children&#x2019;s choir in rehearsal for a Christmas Eve concert. Inspired to honor a local artist, Sophia has chosen a carol set to a poem by Longfellow, moved by the glorious words he penned one Christmas Day long ago, even as he suffered great loss.<br><br><i>Christmas Bells</i>&nbsp;chronicles the events of 1863, when the peace and contentment of&nbsp;Longfellow&#x2019;s&nbsp;family circle was suddenly, tragically broken, cutting even deeper than the privations of wartime. Through the pain of profound loss and hardship, Longfellow&#x2019;s patriotism never failed, nor did the power of his language. &#x201c;Christmas Bells,&#x201d; the poem he wrote that holiday, lives on, spoken as verse and sung as a hymn.&nbsp;<br><br>Jennifer Chiaverini&#x2019;s resonant and heartfelt novel for the season reminds us why we must continue to hear glad tidings, even as we are tested by strife. Reading&nbsp;<i>Christmas Bells</i>&nbsp;evokes the resplendent joy of a chorus of voices raised in reverent song.</p><p><b>Jennifer Chiaverini </b>is the New York Times bestselling author of Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s Dressmaker, The Spymistress, Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s Rival, and Mrs. Grant and Madame Jule, as well as the Elm Creek Quilts series, including The Christmas Quilt. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin.&nbsp;<p>CHAPTER ONE<br><br><i>The Music Teacher&#x2019;s Tale</i><br>Only the most jaded of critics would deny that the Winter Holiday Concert had been an artistic triumph, and as far as Sophia could tell as the audience filed from the auditorium to meet the young performers in the cafeteria for juice and cookies, no one fitting that description had attended. Granted, the fourth-grade recorders might have been a little shrill on &#x201c;Frosty the Snowman,&#x201d; and perhaps half of the second grade had mumbled all but the chorus of &#x201c;I Have a Little Dreidel,&#x201d; and Sophia should have known better than to assign a treble solo to a boy who had started the semester as a sweet-voiced cherub but now looked as if Santa might need to bring him a shaving kit for Christmas. But despite those few glitches, the children had performed beautifully. Certainly the rapturous smiles and the crash of applause that met their curtain calls proved that the audience had been well pleased.</p><p>With the assistance of the school custodian and a few helpful fifth-grade girls, Sophia soon had the costumes packed away, the cardboard sets dismantled, and the stage put in order, or at least as orderly as it could be, given the loose floorboards, the threadbare curtain, and the empty sockets they had insufficient lightbulbs to fill. Sophia knew they were lucky to have a theater at all, considering that decades of overcrowding had forced other local schools to convert performance spaces into classrooms. Sophia shared her music room with the art teacher, Yolanda, who served three different schools in the district and came to Peleg Wadsworth Elementary only twice a week. Yolanda had to haul most of her supplies from school to school, packing them into her fourteen-year-old compact car like pieces of a puzzle designed by Escher. Although she was by nature cheerfully optimistic, Yolanda looked perpetually harried and distracted as she pushed her overloaded plastic cart from parking lot to classroom and back, and she had developed a habit of constantly checking her watch and glancing at calendars to make sure she was at the right school on the right day. &#x201c;Artists must suffer,&#x201d; she joked whenever Sophia asked how she was doing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never felt more artistic.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia and her stage crew finished tidying up in time to join the reception in its final minutes. Empty bottles of apple juice filled the cafeteria&#x2019;s recycling bin, and only a few broken cookies remained of the plates of treats donated by the performers&#x2019; families. Sophia savored each delicious bite of the last gingerbread reindeer, modestly accepting praise and congratulations from parents, grandparents, and staff. As the crowd dwindled, Sophia returned to her classroom to pack up her things, gifts from her students, and projects to grade over the winter break. Her stomach growled; she could have used a second cookie and a strong cup of coffee. If she hurried, she might have time to grab something on the way from school to choir practice at St. Margaret&#x2019;s Catholic Church, where she volunteered as the children&#x2019;s music director.</p><p>She had just wrapped herself in a scarf and was slipping into her black wool coat when Linda, the principal&#x2019;s thin, gray-haired secretary, appeared in the classroom doorway. &#x201c;Oh, good, Sophia. I caught you.&#x201d; She peered over the rim of her bifocals at the overstuffed satchel on Sophia&#x2019;s desk, so full of little handmade gifts, cards, and carefully wrapped sweets that it could not close. &#x201c;Impressive. You brought in quite a haul this year.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia smiled as she buttoned her coat. &#x201c;Yes, I should be fully stocked with fudge and peppermint through Epiphany.&#x201d;</p><p>Linda laughed, but her amusement swiftly faded. &#x201c;Janine would like to see you in her office before you leave.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia felt a flutter of nerves. &#x201c;Did she say why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should talk to her.&#x201d; Linda edged out of the doorway looking pained. &#x201c;Have a nice winter break. Merry Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Merry Christmas,&#x201d; Sophia replied as Linda hurried away.</p><p>Sophia&#x2019;s certainty that something was amiss rose as she entered the administration offices and the dean of students wished her happy holidays in a voice usually reserved for offering condolences.</p><p>She found Janine standing behind her desk in her private office, frowning thoughtfully as she examined papers in a file. &#x201c;Sophia,&#x201d; she said, glancing up, warmly professional as she gestured to a chair on the opposite side. &#x201c;Thank you for coming. Please, have a seat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It never gets easier,&#x201d; Sophia said lightly as she set her bag on the floor, loosened her scarf, and took her seat. &#x201c;Being called to the principal&#x2019;s office, I mean, whether you&#x2019;re a student or a teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>Janine Washington had been the principal of Peleg Wadsworth Elementary for eight years, and under her direction attendance had soared, test scores had risen, and suspensions had plummeted so low that the faculty dared hope they had become a thing of the past. Sophia had arrived on the scene three years into Janine&#x2019;s tenure, a student teacher full of idealism and grand plans to find a well-paying job with a prestigious music program in an affluent district as soon as she graduated. Instead, she had fallen in love with the children of Watertown and with Janine&#x2019;s vision of how to give them the excellent education they deserved, the kind their more fortunate peers in Beacon Hill and the Back Bay took for granted.</p><p>&#x201c;The concert was excellent,&#x201d; Janine said. &#x201c;I think it was the children&#x2019;s best yet&#x2014;and yours. Congratulations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Spiritedly, Sophia added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very proud of the students. Each and every one of them did their very best.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I agree. That makes what I have to tell you all the more difficult.&#x201d; Janine regarded her sympathetically. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware, I&#x2019;m sure, that the measure to raise the tax levy to increase the education budget failed to pass in last month&#x2019;s election.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; For weeks, every conversation in the teachers&#x2019; lounge had circled back to the ballot measure. In the days leading up to the election, Sophia had passed out leaflets encouraging citizens to vote yes, and, lacking a car, she had placed a bumper sticker in the window of her apartment. It was still there, a memorial to the failed measure, a reprimand to those who had supported the cause but had neglected to go to the polls, and a promise to herself to fight harder next time. &#x201c;But the district will draw on emergency funds to make up the difference, right? I read that there&#x2019;s enough for the rest of this academic year and the next. By that time the measure will be on the ballot again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid those estimates were overly optimistic,&#x201d; said Janine. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t take into account the mold problem at the high school, or the dip in interest rates. The district&#x2019;s reserves have been dealt quite a blow. I&#x2019;ve been informed that at their next meeting, the school board plans to introduce new austerity measures.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Austerity measures?&#x201d; Sophia echoed. &#x201c;You mean budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Emergency budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Sophia sat back in her chair, dismayed. It was no secret which programs were the first to be sacrificed in an emergency. &#x201c;Janine, children need music in their lives. Most of our students aren&#x2019;t likely to get any arts education if they don&#x2019;t get it here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been proven scientifically that music lessons help children&#x2019;s brain development and result in higher test scores, especially in math, and significantly fewer discipline problems. Students without education in the arts are five times more likely to drop out of school. Five times!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Janine raised a hand to calm her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read the reports. I&#x2019;ve helped write many of them. However, when deciding whether to fund fifth-grade chorus or keep the furnaces going, most people, including those in charge of our budget, see only one logical choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does this mean for me?&#x201d; Sophia asked, fighting to keep her voice from quavering. &#x201c;Will I have to travel from school to school like Yolanda, spending a few days here and a few days there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone will,&#x201d; said Janine gently. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m afraid that won&#x2019;t be you. The two other music teachers in the district have seniority. They&#x2019;ll drop to half time and share the single position that will remain. Sophia, I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re going to be laid off.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia stared at her, scarcely able to breathe. &#x201c;Going to be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. At the end of the school year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, thank God. I thought you meant I was done, finished, today, without having the chance to say goodbye to anyone&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. That would be a shameful way to repay you for the five years of exemplary service you&#x2019;ve offered our school.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia forced a wan smile. &#x201c;Would you be willing to put that in a letter of recommendation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m telling you now, even at the risk of losing you halfway through next semester, to give you time to find another position.&#x201d; Janine leaned forward and folded her arms on her desk, her expression full of regret and compassion. &#x201c;I know you were considering a move to Chicago, and that you had several promising leads there. Perhaps it&#x2019;s time to follow up on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s . . . not really an option. I&#x2019;m not moving to Chicago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought your fianc� had accepted a job there. I hear things in passing through the teachers&#x2019; lounge, but perhaps I misunderstood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Brandon did take that job in Chicago, but he&#x2019;s not my fianc� anymore.&#x201d; Not since October, when Sophia realized that she couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave her family&#x2014;and her job and her students and her choir at St. Margaret&#x2019;s&#x2014;to follow him. She <i>could</i> have, but she didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to&#x2014;which forced her to admit that marrying Brandon would be a mistake even if he weren&#x2019;t moving away.</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said Janine. &#x201c;My apologies. I wasn&#x2019;t aware.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your fault. I announced the engagement, but not the end of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still regret bringing up an unhappy subject and making a difficult conversation even worse.&#x201d; Janine rose and came around her desk to rest her hand on Sophia&#x2019;s shoulder, a motherly gesture that brought tears to Sophia&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;We can talk more after winter break. I&#x2019;ll see you in January.&#x201d;</p><p>Sophia stammered out a perfunctory reply and hurried from the office, keeping her head down as she left the school rather than be drawn into a conversation with any concerned coworkers she might encounter along the way. Outside, a capricious wind drove a burst of snow crystals into her face, startling her so that she gasped, but when the shock faded, she settled into an unexpected sense of calm. She had lost her job, but Janine had given her six months&#x2019; notice. She would finish out the year as if nothing had changed, and surely she could find a new teaching position sometime before Labor Day.</p><p>She wrapped her scarf more securely about her neck&#x2014;her eldest sister had knit it for her out of the softest cashmere, and it was as warm as it was elegant&#x2014;adjusted the strap of her overstuffed bag to shift the weight to a more comfortable position, and set off on foot for St. Margaret&#x2019;s Catholic Church.</p><p>She dreaded breaking the news to her parents, who were, as ever, fraught with concern for her over the broken engagement and other disappointments. When Sophia was much younger, her parents had encouraged her dreams to become a renowned opera singer, their faith scarcely wavering even when she was not accepted at Juilliard or Oberlin. By the end of her first year as a voice major at Boston College, after many inspiring and humbling months learning and performing with other eager young students&#x2014;all of whom, like her, had been the best singer in their high school choirs and had won every lead in drama club&#x2014;she began to realize that she was talented, but perhaps not talented enough. Suffering a crisis of confidence, she had poured out her heart to her kind but pragmatic academic advisor. He had encouraged her to continue to study music, since it was her passion, but also to expand her repertoire to teaching, the better to share that passion with others.</p><p>It proved to be excellent advice. Sophia had not long been a teacher when she realized that she was privileged and blessed to be able to pursue that calling, and now she could not imagine a more enriching or meaningful career. That made it easier to forgive her parents&#x2019; unspoken disappointment that she had settled for less than her potential had promised, easier to endure the disdain of strangers who dismissed her as &#x201c;only a teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>She would figure it out, she told herself firmly as she strode along, chin buried in her scarf, hands tucked into her pockets, shoulders braced against the flurry in the wind.</p></p><h2>Knopf Guide: London (Knopf City Guides)</h2><p>"Encyclopedic in their historic, artistic and touristic detail." -- <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i><br><br>Legend has it that as long as the ravens remain safe in the Tower of London, the stately city and the kingdom of England will not fall.

In 2007 Love in the Present Tense was selected for the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club. Catherine lives in Cambria, California.This is the part that&#x2019;s going to be hard to explain: How can I tell you why two people who were afraid of everything&#x2013;other people, open places, noise, confusion, life itself&#x2013;wound up riding the subways alone under Manhattan late at night?<br><br>Okay, it&#x2019;s like this: When everything is unfamiliar and scary, your heart pounds just getting change from the grocery cashier. That feels like enough to kill you right there. So the danger of the subways at night can&#x2019;t be much worse. All danger begins to fall into the same category. You have no way to sink any deeper into fear.<br><br>Besides, consider the alternative. Staying home. <br><br>That&#x2019;s enough about that for now. I need to tell you about her.<br><br>She got on the Lexington Avenue Local at...what was it?...I think Union Square. Funny how a thing like that can be so damned important, but you don&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;s important until an instant later in the big scheme of time. Then you go back and try to retrieve it. You tell yourself it&#x2019;s in there somewhere. But it&#x2019;s really in that no-man&#x2019;s-land of the moment before you woke up and started paying attention to your own life.<br><br>I&#x2019;m pretty sure it was Union Square.<br><br>At first we looked at each other for a split second, but of course we looked away immediately. It&#x2019;s part of what makes us like the animals, I suppose. Ever seen two dogs circling to fight? They look right into each other&#x2019;s eyes. It&#x2019;s a challenge. So when a dog doesn&#x2019;t want to challenge anybody, he looks away. In case I haven&#x2019;t made it clear by now, we were two dogs who weren&#x2019;t looking for a fight.<br><br>But then, after we both looked away, we weren&#x2019;t afraid of each other anymore. We knew we didn&#x2019;t have to be. I mean, except to the extent that we were afraid of everything.<br><br>There was no one else on the car. It rumbled along again, with that special rocking, and the clacking noise, the lights flashing off now and then. And the heat. It was only May, but the heat had started early. It was after midnight, so I guess you&#x2019;d think it was all cooled off by then, but it wasn&#x2019;t. A little bit cooler up on the street. Not so much down there. It was stuffy, like more air would be nice.<br><br>Every now and then we&#x2019;d hear a noise that could have been somebody opening the door from another car. And we&#x2019;d jump in unison, and look up. But it was never anybody. Just the two of us all the way to the end of the line.<br><br>Once I looked over at her while she was looking away. Her hair was dark and thick and about down to her shoulders. Her face was thin, like the rest of her. I couldn&#x2019;t figure out if there was something angular about her face, or something almost delicate. Maybe both. <br><br>I was trying to get a bead on how old she was. Older than me, that&#x2019;s for sure. I mean, she was a full-grown woman. But young enough, I guess. But maybe old compared to me. Early twenties.<br>Every inch of her was covered. Except her face. Jeans, boots, some kind of shawl thing wrapped around her. Seemed like too much to wear in that heat. <br><br>And a hat. She was wearing a hat over all that dark hair. A gray felt thing with a big brim. So all she had to do was dip her head an inch or two, and she was gone again. She could break off eye contact just like that. It seemed like such a great plan. I wondered why I&#x2019;d never thought of it myself.<br><br>And on one cheek, a dark spot. Not exactly a bruise, but something like one. Like a shadow. Like she&#x2019;d had some sort of an accident. <br><br>I think I remember feeling that it was a lovely face, but maybe I&#x2019;m adding that in after the fact. It&#x2019;s hard to go back and describe what you thought of such an important face the first time you saw it. The memory gets colored with all those other things you felt later on. It&#x2019;s hard to separate them out again. But whatever I thought about her face, I noticed it. And it held me.<br><br>Then she looked up and I quick looked away.<br><br>At the end of the line, we both waited. And neither one of us got off the train.<br><br>You see, it says a lot about someone when they don&#x2019;t get off at the end of the line. When they just sit there with the doors open until the train starts back the other way. Right back to&#x2013;or past&#x2013;where they started out in the first place. That says a lot.<br><br>After the train started back up again, she looked right into my eyes. She didn&#x2019;t look away and neither did I.<br><br>Something happened in me. I&#x2019;m not sure how good I&#x2019;ll be at explaining what it was. But it was an actual physical something. Something in my body. And I&#x2019;m not going to go into any personal information about certain body reactions, because some things I&#x2019;m just not comfortable discussing. Some things a gentleman doesn&#x2019;t talk about. Or, anyway, that&#x2019;s what I believe. But something happened in my gut. Like all of a sudden something that used to be solid in there turned to water. Hot water. In my arms, too, around my elbows. And a little bit down my legs. Especially around my knees. I remembered hearing an expression about being weak in the knees, and I guess I understood it for the first time. And there was a tingling associated with all this. A kind of all-over tingling, but mostly in my face. Which felt a little hot, like it might be turning red.<br><br>Then it was too much and we both looked away again. But not the same way we had before.<br><br>We rode like that for another hour or so, and never looked at each other after that. I wanted to look, but I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to do it.<br><br>Then I woke up&#x2013;which was weird because I&#x2019;d never felt myself go to sleep&#x2013;and I was on that subway car by myself, and she was gone. I looked at my watch, and it was after three.<br><br>All I could think was that I wanted to talk to Delilah about this. About what had just happened. But, what had just happened? What was I supposed to say? There was this woman on the subway, and she looked at me. But in the few weeks I&#x2019;d been talking to Delilah, every time I told her something I&#x2019;d been feeling, she seemed to know what that feeling was. It made me seem almost... normal.<br><br>***<br><br>When I got home, the apartment was dark and quiet, and of course my father was asleep. I came in on my tiptoes, even though it&#x2019;s pretty hard to wake him after he&#x2019;s taken his sleeping pill. You&#x2019;d almost have to be trying. But I was careful all the same.<br><br>I looked at myself in my bathroom mirror. I wanted to look at myself the way someone else would look at me. I wanted to see what she saw.<br><br>I discovered something strange about myself in that moment. The moment I caught my own eyes in the mirror, I looked away. It was hard to force myself to look at myself. I wasn&#x2019;t bad to look at. It wasn&#x2019;t that. I wasn&#x2019;t the handsomest guy in the world, but I wasn&#x2019;t ugly. I guess I thought I looked fine. But it was almost as though I&#x2019;d never really looked into my own eyes before. Like it was as hard to look at myself as it was to look at somebody else. And I wasn&#x2019;t sure what that meant. Unless it meant I was the kind of dog who didn&#x2019;t even want to challenge myself.<br><br>In the morning, I came to the breakfast table, and my father was staring at me. Taking my emotional temperature, as I like to put it. He only looked away once, to look at his watch. That was his way of telling me I&#x2019;d slept too long.

The centerpiece of such classic films as Marie Antoinette , Private Lives and The Women , Shearer was equally well-known for her marriage to boy-mogul cum Hollywood myth Irving Thalberg. Lambert's opening chapter, in which he meets the long-retired, septuagenarian film legend in a Hollywood restaurant, holds the promise of a guided tour to the outer reaches of ambition and vanity. But Shearer's mask is opaque, and Lambert ( On Cukor ) is unable to peel it away. Preposterously vain and steel-willed even from the grave, the actress ultimately triumphs over her biographer as the keeper of her own flame. Photos. (May) .<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Norma Shearer was queen of the MGM lot in the 1930s. Married to the studio's head of production, Irving Thalberg, Shearer starred in such movies as The Divorcee , The Women , and Idiot's Delight . She was nominated for five Academy Awards, and won one. Her last film was released in 1942, but Shearer lived until 1983. In comparison to Lawrence J. Quirk's Norma: The Story of Norma Shearer (St. Martin's, 1988), Lambert's book is more detached, although both authors interviewed Shearer. Quirk comes across as more of a fan and features more quotes from Shearer's coworkers. Lambert's book has more insight.

Rebelling against the wholesome, organic values of her home life, Cressy decides to leave home in search of more ephemeral pleasures. Taking a job in an antiques shop, she meets David, a self-satisfied journalist, also looking for means of fleeing the family nest. But as Cressy cannot fend for herself and David is securely tied to his mother&#39;s apron strings, this act of escape for both of them proves a powerful form of bondage.

I don't know what I achieved in the six months I'm going to tell about. I achieved something, all right, but I think it may take me the rest of my life to find out what.<br><br> I never won any letters for anything. When I was a little kid, I really liked touch football, the strategy of it, but being short for my age I was always a bit slow even though I was good at evasive tactics. And then when we got into high school, it all got so organized. Going out for teams and wearing uniforms and all that stuff. And people talk about it all the time. Sports are neat to do, but dull to talk about. Anyhow there won't be much about sports in this.<br><br> I am talking into a tape recorder and then typing it. I tried to just write it, but it came out all stuffy and clotted-up with words, so let's see how it goes this way. My name is Owen Thomas Griffiths. I was seventeen in November. I am still fairly short for my age-"5 7". I guess I will be short for my age when I'm forty-five, so what's the difference? It bothered me a lot when I was twelve or thirteen, but I was much shorter then compared to other kids, a genuine shrimp. At fifteen I grew six inches in eight months and felt really awful while I was doing it; my knees used to feel like the Bamboo Splinter Torture, but when it was over I was such a giant compared to what I had been that I never could really regret not going on any higher. I am average compact build and have dirty gray eyes and a lot of hair. The hair is curly, and whether I wear it short or long it sticks out all over my head. I fight it with a hairbrush every morning, and lose. I like my hair. It has a lot of willpower. However, this story is not about my hair, either.<br><br> I am always the youngest person in my class. And the youngest person in my family, being the only child. They let me into school early because I was such a bright little jerk. I have always been bright for my age. Who knows, at forty-five I may still be bright for my age. That is partly what this thing I'm telling, this story, is about. About being a bright little jerk.<br><br> It's OK, you know, up to about the sixth grade. Nobody really cares, least of all yourself. The teachers are mostly pretty nice to you, because you're easy to teach. Some of them love you for it, and give you neat books for extra reading. Some of them resent it, but they're too busy with the Behavior Problem types to have time to really make you feel lousy for being ahead of the others in math and reading. And there's always a few other kids, usually girls, who are as smart as you are, or smarter, and you and they write the class skits, and make lists for the teacher, and so on. And besides, for all the talk about how cruel little kids are, they haven't got a patch on older people for cruelty. Little kids are just dumb, the smart ones and the slow ones. They do dumb things. They say what they think. They haven't learned enough yet to say what they don't really think. That comes later, when kids begin to turn into people and find out that they are alone.<br><br> I think what you mostly do when you find you really are alone is to panic. You rush to the opposite extreme and pack yourself into groups-clubs, teams, societies, types. You suddenly start dressing exactly like the others. It's a way of being invisible. The way you sew the patches on the holes in your blue jeans becomes incredibly important. If you do it wrong you're not with it. You have to be with it. That's a peculiar phrase, you know? With it. With what? With them. With the others. All together. Safety in numbers. I'm not me. I'm a basketball letter. I'm a popular kid. I'm my friends' friend. I'm a black leather growth on a Honda. I'm a member. I'm a teen-ager. You can't see me, all you can see is us. We're safe.<br><br> And if We see You standing alone by yourself, if you're lucky we'll ignore you. If you're not lucky, we might throw rocks. Because we don't like people standing there with the wrong kind of patches on their blue jeans reminding us that we're each alone and none of us is safe.<br><br> I tried. I really did. I tried so hard it makes me sick to think about it. I did my jeans patches exactly like Bill Ebold who did everything right. I talked about baseball scores. I worked for the school paper for one term, because that was the one group that I could figure out how to get into. But none of it worked. I don't know why. Sometimes I wonder if introverts have a peculiar smell, which only extraverts are aware of.<br><br> Some kids really don't have much Me at all. They truly are part of the group. But a lot of them just act-pretend-the way I tried to. Their heart isn't really in the groups, but still they get along, they get by. I wish I could. I honestly wish I could be a good hypocrite. It doesn't hurt anybody, and it sure makes life easier. But I never could fool anybody. They knew I wasn't interested in what interested them, and they despised me for it, and I despised them for despising me. But then I also despised the few kids who didn't try to go along. In ninth grade there was this tall kid who never brushed his teeth and wore a white sports coat to school, who wanted to make friends with me. I should have been delighted; I mean, nobody had ever wanted to make friends with me before. But he kept saying things like what a drip this person was and what a dolt that one was, and although I agreed with him I didn't want to talk about it all the time, and so I despised him for being a snob. And then I despised myself for despising everybody else. Oh, it's a really neat situation to be in. You know what I mean, if you've been there.<br><br> Since I was trying hard not to be different, I didn't want to be a straight-A type; but that problem was always solved for me by gym. I wasn't any worse at gym than a lot of fellows, but I got D's because I cut it all the time because I couldn't take Mr. Thorpe. "If you can take your minds off Keats and Shelley for a while, Griffiths, you might at least stand around and watch how basketball is played." It was always Keats and Shelley-I heard him use exactly the same line to at least two other fellows. He said it with real hatred, hissing: Keatsssnssshelley, ssssss. It was stupid applied to me, since math and science is where I am good, but that hatred got me so curious I went back and read Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale" in the freshman lit text. They didn't give us any Shelley, but I looked up his collected works at the city library, and later on I bought it secondhand. So it was Mr. Thorpe teaching basketball who put me on to "Prometheus Unbound." I should be grateful. But it still didn't make third period with Mr. Thorpe any easier.<br><br> But- this is important-I never talked back. I never said anything. I could have said, "Look, Mr. Thorpe, I don't want to take my mind off Keats and Shelley, or sines and cosines, so you just go ahead and bounce your little bouncyball, OK?" Some of the kids could do that. Back in elementary school once I heard a little black seventh-grade girl tell off our math teacher, "You just get your hands off my paper, if you don't like it the way I done it, you can just stuff it!" It was pure fight-the teacher hadn't done anything to deserve it, he was just trying to teach the kid some math-but still, it was pure fight, it was courage, and I admired it. I still do. But I can't do it. I haven't got it. I don't get into fights.<br><br> I stand there and take it, till I can run. And then I run.<br><br> Sometimes I not only stand there and take it, I even smile at them and say I'm sorry.<br><br> When I feel that smile coming onto my face, I wish I could take my face off and stamp on it.<br><br>Copyright � 1976 by Ursula K.

As proof that his neighbor is indeed a witch, a young boy describes her traits, one by one. He does so with the logic of a budding lawyer and the earnest appeal of a character that might have been drawn by Judith Viorst. Ms. McWee, the boy says, seemed to know all about him before the two even met. She makes "click clack" noises late at night. Most telling, Ms. McWee just loves Halloween. Naturally, the boy's mother refutes each piece of "evidence," but this does little to dispel hisand oursuspicions. "I'm not so sure," is his repeated and measured reply. The illogical logic and underlying humor of this picture story make it a compelling tale to read, and one which is sure to please young listeners. Black, white and orange illustrations are well suited to the text, combining the mystery and fun of Halloween with caricatures of city living. Both author and illustrator reach the same conclusion: whether or not Ms. McWee is a witch, she is certainly a charmed and captivating character. Anne E.

The twenty-five-year-old officer had been brought into the Scottish Military Hospital on June 15, 1941, paralyzed from the waist down. A letter to his mother from the War Office stated that he had suffered &#x201c;a contusion of the back as a result of enemy action.&#x201d;<br><br> This was not, strictly speaking, true. The injured soldier had not set eyes on the enemy: he had jumped out of a plane, without a helmet or proper training, ripped his parachute on the tail and plummeted to earth at roughly twice the recommended speed. The impact had knocked him out and badly injured his spine, leaving him temporarily blinded and without feeling in his legs. The doctors feared he would never walk again.<br><br> Even before his parachuting accident, the officer&#x2019;s contribution to the war effort had been minimal: he lacked the most basic military discipline, could not march straight, and was so lazy his comrades had nicknamed him &#x201c;the Giant Sloth.&#x201d; Since being posted to Egypt with the British commando force, he had spent much of his time in Cairo&#x2019;s bars and clubs, or gambling at the racecourse. The nurses at the hospital knew him well, for he frequently popped in during the morning, whey-faced and liverish, to request a blast from the oxygen bottle to cure his hangover. Before his parachute jump landed him in the hospital, he had been under investigation&nbsp;to establish whether he was malingering and ought to be court-martialed. His fellow officers found him charming and entertaining; his senior commanders, for the most part, regarded him as impertinent, incompetent, and profoundly irritating. On completing officer training, he had received a blunt appraisal: &#x201c;irresponsible and unremarkable.&#x201d;<br><br> Lieutenant David Stirling of the Scots Guards was not a conventional soldier.<br><br> The writer Evelyn Waugh, a fellow officer in the commando force, came to visit Stirling about three weeks after his admission to the hospital. Waugh had been misinformed by the matron that one of Stirling&#x2019;s legs had already been amputated, and he would likely lose the other. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t feel a thing,&#x201d; Stirling told his friend. Embarrassed, as Englishmen tend to be when faced with disability, Waugh kept up a steady stream of meaningless small talk, perched on the edge of the bed, and studiously avoided the subject of his friend&#x2019;s paralysis. Every so often, however, he would sneak a surreptitious glance to where Stirling&#x2019;s remaining leg ought to be, and whenever he did so Stirling, with extreme effort, would wiggle the big toe of his right foot. Finally, Waugh realized he was being teased, and hit Stirling with a pillow.<br><br> &#x201c;You bastard, Stirling, when did it happen?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Minutes before you came. It takes a bit of effort, but it&#x2019;s a start.&#x201d;<br><br> Stirling was regaining the use of his legs. Others might have cried for joy; for Stirling, however, the first sign of his recovery was an excellent opportunity to play a practical joke on one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest novelists.<br><br> It would take two more weeks before Stirling could stand upright, and several more before he was able to hobble about. But during those two months of enforced inaction he did a great deal of thinking&#x2014;something that, in spite of his reputation as a feckless gadabout, he was rather good at.<br><br> The commandos were intended to be Britain&#x2019;s storm troops, volunteers selected and trained to carry out destructive raids&nbsp;against Axis targets. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had decided that the ideal theater in which to deploy the commandos would be North Africa, where they could conduct seaborne raids against enemy bases along the Mediterranean coast.<br><br> In Stirling&#x2019;s unsolicited opinion, the concept was not working. Most of the time the commandos were inactive, awaiting the order for a great assault that never came; on the rare occasions when they were deployed, the results had been disappointing. The German and Italian troops fully expected to be attacked from the sea, and were primed and waiting. The commando forces were simply too large and cumbersome to launch an assault without being spotted; the element of surprise was immediately lost.<br><br> But what, wondered Stirling, if the combat troops attacked from the opposite direction? To the south, stretching between Egypt and Libya, lay the Great Sand Sea, a vast, waterless expanse of unbroken dunes covering forty-five thousand square miles. One of the most inhospitable environments on earth, the desert was considered by the Germans to be virtually impassable, a natural barrier, and they therefore left it largely unprotected, and entirely unpatrolled. &#x201c;This was one sea the Hun was not watching,&#x201d; Stirling reflected. If mobile teams of highly trained men, under cover of darkness, could be infiltrated onto the enemy&#x2019;s desert flank, they might be able to sabotage airfields, supply depots, communications links, railways, and roads, and then slip back into the embracing emptiness of the sand sea. A commando force several hundred strong could attack only one target at a time; but a number of smaller units, moving quickly, raiding suddenly and then retreating swiftly, could destroy multiple targets simultaneously. The opportunity to attack the enemy in the rear, when he least expects it, is the pipe dream of every general. The peculiar geography of North Africa offered just such a possibility, reflected Stirling, as he lay half paralyzed in his hospital bed, trying to wiggle his toes.<br><br> Stirling&#x2019;s idea was the result of wishful thinking more than expertise; it had emerged not from long hours of reflection and&nbsp;study, but from the acute boredom of convalescence. It was based on intuition, imagination, and self-confidence, of which Stirling had plenty, rather than experience of desert warfare, of which he had none. But it was an inspired idea, and the sort of idea that could only have occurred to someone as strange and remarkable as Archibald David Stirling.<br><br> Stirling was one of those people who thrive in war, having failed at peace. In a short life, he had tried his hand at a variety of occupations&#x2014;artist, architect, cowboy, and mountaineer&#x2014;and found success in none of them. Privileged by birth and education, intelligent and resourceful, he could have done anything, but had spent the early part of his life doing little of any consequence. The war was his salvation.<br><br> The Stirling family was one of the oldest and grandest in Scotland, an aristocratic clan of great distinction, long military traditions, and considerable eccentricity. David Stirling&#x2019;s mother was the daughter of Lord Lovat, the chief of Clan Fraser, with bloodlines stretching back to Charles II. His father, General Archibald Stirling, had been gassed in the First World War, served as an MP, and then retired to Keir, the fifteen thousand-acre Perthshire estate that had been the family&#x2019;s seat for the previous five centuries. The general presided over his sprawling lands and unruly family like some benign but distant chieftain observing a battlefield from a remote hill. David&#x2019;s formidable mother, Margaret, was the more forceful presence: her children were in awe of her. Keir House, where David Stirling was born in 1915, was a vast edifice, freezing cold even at the height of summer, filled with old hunting trophies, noise, and devilment. The Stirling parents drummed good manners into their six children, but otherwise largely left them to get on with their lives. The four Stirling boys, of whom David was the second in age, grew up stalking deer, hunting rabbits, fighting, and competing. One favorite game was a form of sibling duel using air rifles: two brothers would take potshots at each other&#x2019;s backsides in turn, moving closer by a pace after each shot.<br><br> Despite this aristocratically spartan start in life, David Stirling was not a hardy child. Dispatched to Ampleforth, a Catholic boarding school, at the age of eight, he caught typhoid fever and was sent home for an extended period of recovery. A speech impediment was eventually cured by surgery. He disliked sports, and did his best to avoid them. He grew at an astonishing rate: by the age of seventeen, he was nearly six feet, six inches tall, a gangly beanpole, willful, reckless, and exceptionally polite. Largely by virtue of his class, he was awarded a place at Cambridge University, where he misbehaved on a lavish scale, spending more time at Newmarket racecourse than he devoted to studying. &#x201c;If there was a serious side to life it totally escaped me,&#x201d; he later admitted. If he ever opened a book, the event was not recorded. After a year, the master of his college informed him that he was being sent down, read out a list of twenty-three offenses that merited expulsion, and invited him to select the three that he considered &#x201c;would be least offensive&#x201d; to his mother.<br><br> David Stirling decided he would become an artist, in Paris. He had little talent for painting. But he did have a beret, and a yen for the bohemian life. Some have detected &#x201c;a strange mixture of beauty and the macabre&#x201d; in his paintings. His French art tutor, however, did not, and after a year and a half of louche Left Bank life, he was told that while he might one day make a half-decent commercial draftsman, his &#x201c;painting would never achieve any real merit.&#x201d; Stirling was profoundly upset; his failure as an artist marked him forever, and perhaps explained the consistent ripple of insecurity that lay beneath the carapace of confidence.<br><br> He returned to Cambridge to study architecture, but soon dropped out again. A job with an Edinburgh architect was short-lived. His mother now intervened, and told her second son that he must stop drifting and do something with his life. Stirling&nbsp;announced that he intended to become the first person to climb Mount Everest.<br><br> Stirling was quite the wrong shape to scramble up rocks. He had little experience of serious climbing. He also suffered from vertigo. Intrepid British mountaineers had been trying to scale the world&#x2019;s highest mountain since 1921; dozens had perished in the attempt. Climbing Everest was an expensive, dangerous, demanding business, and Stirling was broke&#x2014;none of which dented his determination to succeed where other, qualified, experienced, well-funded mountaineers had failed. He spent a year climbing in the Swiss Alps, bankrolled by his mother, before joining the supplementary reserve of the Scots Guards, his father&#x2019;s regiment, in the hope that part-time army training might bolster his mountaineering quest. He soon drifted out of uniform, repelled by the mind-swamping boredom of the parade ground. In 1938, at the age of twenty-three, he went to the United States with the intention of climbing the Rockies and riding across the Continental Divide. He was south of the Rio Grande, having spent several months herding cattle in the company of a cowboy named Roy &#x201c;Panhandle&#x201d; Terrill when he learned that Britain was at war&#x2014;the run-up to which had, it seems, almost entirely passed him by. His mother sent a telegram: &#x201c;Return home by the cheapest possible means.&#x201d; Stirling flew to Britain on a first-class ticket, and rushed back into uniform.<br><br> The David Stirling who turned up at the Guards Depot in Pirbright in the autumn of 1939 was a strange mixture of parts. Ambitious but unfocused; steeped in soldierly traditions but allergic to military discipline. A boisterous exterior belied a man prone to periodic depressions, whose extreme good manners and social ease masked moments of inner turmoil. Stirling was a romantic, with an innate talent for friendship but little desire or need for physical intimacy. He appears to have lost his virginity in Paris as an art student. With Panhandle Terrill he had enjoyed the company of &#x201c;some of those dark girls down in Mexico.&#x201d; But his natural shyness coupled with a stern all-male Catholic education seems to&nbsp;have left him in fear of women. &#x201c;The totally confused, guilt-ridden years of puberty exerted an awful pressure,&#x201d; he once remarked. He spoke of &#x201c;predatory females&#x201d;; his few romantic encounters were described as &#x201c;close escapes,&#x201d; as if he feared entrapment. &#x201c;Bonds of any sort are a pressure I find very difficult to bear,&#x201d; he admitted. He had many women friends, and according to his biographer was &#x201c;not unattracted to the opposite sex.&#x201d; Yet he seemed to relax only among men, and &#x201c;in wide open spaces.&#x201d; Like many convivial people, he was slightly lonely. A warrior monk, he craved action and the company of soldiers, but when the fighting was over, he embraced solitude.<br><br> Stirling was also possessed of a profound self-belief, the sort of confidence that comes from high birth and boundless opportunity. He was blithely unconstrained by convention, and regarded rules as nuisances to be ignored, broken, or otherwise overcome. He was elaborately respectful toward his social inferiors, and showed no deference whatever to rank. Strikingly modest, he was repelled by braggarts and loudmouths: &#x201c;swanks&#x201d; (swanking) or &#x201c;pomposo&#x201d; (pomposity) were his gravest insults. His manner seemed vague and forgetful, but his powers of concentration were phenomenal. Despite an ungainly body and a patchy academic record, he had a stubborn faith in his own abilities, intellectual and physical. Stirling did exactly what he wanted to do, whether or not others thought his aims were sensible or even possible. The SAS came into being, in part, because its founder would not take no for an answer, either from those in authority or from those under his command.<br><br> Just as he had been bored by the logistics of mountaineering, so Stirling found the practical preparations for war indescribably tedious. Like many young men, he was hungry for the fight, but instead found himself shackled to a regime of endless marching, kit inspections, weapons drill, and all the other rote elements of military life. So he rebelled. Slipping away from the Guards Depot at Pirbright, he would frequently head to London for a night of drinking, gambling, and billiards at White&#x2019;s club; just as frequently&nbsp;he was caught, and confined to barracks. Stirling was a nightmare recruit: impertinent, indolent, and often half asleep as a result of his carousing the night before. &#x201c;He was quite, quite irresponsible,&#x201d; recalled Willie (later Viscount) Whitelaw, a fellow trainee officer at Pirbright. &#x201c;He just couldn&#x2019;t tolerate that we were being trained along the lines of the last major conflict. His reaction was just to ignore everything.&#x201d;<br><br> It was at the bar of White&#x2019;s, one of the most exclusive gentleman&#x2019;s clubs in London, that Stirling first learned about a form of soldiering that seemed much closer to the adventure and excitement he had in mind: a crack new commando unit intended to hit important enemy targets with maximum impact. Stirling&#x2019;s cousin, Lord Lovat, had been among the first to volunteer for the commandos.<br><br> Formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock, the force&#x2014;christened Layforce&#x2014;would consist of more than 1,500 volunteers formed into three commando regiments, recruited from the Foot Guards (the regular infantry of the Household Division) and other infantry regiments: an elite troop of specialized, highly trained raiders and marauders.

Continuing the theme of &#39;one eye sees, the other feels&#39;, the book moves beyond the senses into an investigation of our basic human drives for survival, safety, love, respect, and self-fulfilment. This is then expanded to how we live, our homes and our daily activities. Despite our increasing reliance on technology to bring ease and comfort to our lives, Ilse says, &#39;we still want a sense of humanity, of home - a space that speaks to us radically and emotionally&#39;. A unique flow of thought-provoking text, evocative photography, and state of the art design combine to produce a reaction in the reader which is as emotional as it is intellectual.</p><p>Ilse Crawford is a strategic designer who has been in the business of predicting what&#39;s next in design for more than a decade.

Accompanied by a gaggle of Japanese office ladies bent on a week of shopping, Rei lands in the capital. But her big break could ultimately break her. Within hours one of the kimonos is stolen, and then Rei's passport is discovered in a shopping mall dumpster&#x2014;on the dead body of one of the Japanese tourists. Trouble is only beginning, though, for now Rei's parents have arrived and so has her ex-boyfriend. To track down the kimono and unmask a killer, Rei's got to do some clever juggling, fast talking, and quick sleuthing, or this trip home could be her last.</p></p><p>Sujata Massey's lively bicultural series featuring Rei Shimura, the Tokyo antique dealer who can't seem to keep out of trouble, brings her heroine back to her American roots in this engaging tale of corruption and chicanery in the museum exhibition game. Rei is unexpectedly invited to accompany a treasure trove of antique kimonos to a Washington, D.C., museum and to deliver a couple of lectures on the cultural history of the gorgeous garments. A last-minute decision to substitute a priceless wedding kimono for one that's too fragile to travel sets in motion a chain of events that lands Rei in serious peril.<p> When Rei's former boyfriend, Scottish attorney Hugh Glendinning, turns up at the Washington museum, she's caught up in a romantic crisis, having just settled into a new relationship with Takeo Kayama, the Japanese playboy she met two books ago (in <i>The Flower Master</i>). But that dilemma is soon eclipsed by the theft of the wedding kimono, which was uninsured, and by the disappearance of Rei's seatmate on the flight from Japan. When the seatmate's dead body and Rei's passport and tickets turn up in a Washington dumpster, Rei is suspected of murder, larceny, and even prostitution. Through all this, Massey does a nice job of imparting a wealth of fascinating information on the kimono tradition.</p><p> Rei gets more appealing with every outing, and in this one Massey ratchets up the romantic tension and action--maybe because Rei's in a country that's more obsessed with sex than with tradition. Nicely plotted, well characterized, and carefully crafted, this may be Massey's best yet. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Sujata Massey was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em> and spent several years in Japan teaching English and studying Japanese.

She has written several books including Wildlife Painting Step by Step and The Best of Wildlife Art. Her work has appeared in Equine Images, The Artist&#39;s Magazine, and Art of the West.Popular artist Harrison has perfected her technique over decades of practice, achieving success in part because of the emotion she both brings to her work and evokes with her expressive animal portraits. She thoroughly explores painting techniques, materials, and lighting, then, dispelling the notion that animals lack feelings because they cannot speak, moves beyond technical considerations to help artists identify and convey animal emotions so that they're "telling their stories" in images rather than words.

The reluctantly loyal Emilia pesters Desdemona about a military promotion for her husband. Her motive, however, is that he leave her a wealthy widow, preferably sooner than later. Bianca, now a street-wise, yet painfully naive prostitute, visits Desdemona thinking she is a very good friend and fellow hooker (at least one night a week). Bianca thinks the worst when she soon discovers that Desdemona knows intimate details of the life of her lover, Cassio.

To settle an old score, ex-Navy SEAL Ted Faircloud recruits two men to help him kill Cuban drug lord Carlos Mendez, but Tanner and Sutton are also hot on Mendez's trailAand in far more danger than they realize. Scott deftly weaves the story together with his usual mix of techno-military jargon and unabashed romance, and while the dialogue often lapses into stereotype (" 'I'm a bad SF sergeant with years of experience snoopin' and poopin' "), the end result is a compulsively readable tale well worth the necessary suspension of disbelief. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ask and It Is Given - Part II: The Processes</h2><p>Ask and It Is Given, by Esther and Jerry Hicks, which presents the teachings of the nonphysical entity Abraham, will help you learn how to manifest your desires so that you&#x2019;re living the joyous and fulfilling life you deserve. As you listen, you&#x2019;ll discover powerful processes that will help you go with the positive flow of life. It&#x2019;s your birthright to live a life filled with everything that is good&#x2014;and this CD set will show you how to make it so in every way!</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks.

Their story gives us unprecedented access to both sides of early Virginia. </p><p>Here for the first time outside scholarly texts is an accurate portrayal of Pocahontas, who, from the age of ten, acted as emissary for her father, who ruled over the local tribes, alongside the never-before-told intertwined stories of Thomas Savage, Henry Spelman, and Robert Poole, young English boys who were forced to live with powerful Indian leaders to act as intermediaries. </p><p>Pocahontas and the English Boys is a riveting seventeenth-century story of intrigue and danger, knowledge and power, and four youths who lived out their lives between cultures. As Pocahontas, Thomas, Henry, and Robert collaborated and conspired in carrying messages and trying to smooth out difficulties, they never knew when they might be caught in the firing line of developing hostilities. While their knowledge and role in controlling communication gave them status and a degree of power, their relationships with both sides meant that no one trusted them completely. </p><p>Written by an expert in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Atlantic history, Pocahontas and the English Boys unearths gems from the archives&#x2015;Henry Spelman&#x2019;s memoir, travel accounts, letters, and official reports and records of meetings of the governor and council in Virginia&#x2015;and draws on recent archaeology to share the stories of the young people who were key influencers of their day and who are now set to transform our understanding of early Virginia.</p></p><p><b>Karen Ordahl Kupperman</b> is Silver Professor of History Emerita at New York University.

Along the way, Bainbridge revisits some of the key puzzles about pregnancy: What's sex got to do with it? How does the fetus hijack its mother's immune system? What is the point, if any, of morning sickness? Just how does a fertilized ovum develop into eight pounds or so of baby, with ten fingers and ten toes? Does the baby or the mother control the onset of labor, and why is it such an ordeal for them both? </p><p> Entertaining and informative, <i>Making Babies</i> shows how the study of human pregnancy can help us understand our genesis as individuals and our evolution as a species, and provide insight into who we are and why we behave as we do.</p></p><p>While it's a safe bet that most readers know where babies come from, it's equally likely that they don't know the whole story. Reproductive biologist David Bainbridge fills them in with <i>Making Babies</i>, a witty and intriguing look at an experience so essential that we all go through it at least once. It would be all too easy for the author to get caught up in the intricacies of hormones and anatomy that have evolved from our egg-laying ancestors, but he softens the details with insights and examples from throughout the animal kingdom. Expectant parents might not like being compared to red deer at first, but most will warm to their shared experience. Examining big questions like "Why have sex?" and "How does the fetus change the mother?" is daunting, but Bainbridge guides the reader through the issues with confidence and humility. It's no substitute for a birds-and-bees chat, but <i>Making Babies</i> is perfect for those who want to deepen their understanding of what happens next. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>David Bainbridge</b> is University Clinical Veterinary Anatomist at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St. Catharine's College.</p><h2>King Solomon&#39;s Ring</h2><p>New Light on Animal Ways.

Only a writer of W.G. Beasley's stature could render Japan's complicated past so concisely and elegantly. This is the history of a society and a culture with a distinct sense of itself, one of the few nations never conquered by a foreign power in historic times (until the twentieth century) and the home of the longest-reigning imperial dynasty that still survives. The Japanese have always occupied part or all of the same territory, its borders defined by the sea. They have spoken and written a common language, (once it had taken firm shape in about the tenth century) and their population has been largely homogeneous, little touched by immigration except in very early periods. Yet Japanese society and culture have changed more through time than these statements seem to imply. Developments within Japan have been greatly influenced by ideas and institutions, art and literature, imported from elsewhere. In this work Beasley, a leading authority on Japan and the author of a number of acclaimed works on Japanese history, examines the changing society and culture of Japan and considers what, apart from the land and the people, is specifically Japanese about the history of Japan.<br><br>The arrival of Buddhism in the sixth century brought a substantially Chinese-style society to Japan, not only in religion but in political institutions, writing system, and the lifestyle of the ruling class. By the eleventh century the Chinese element was waning and the country was entering a long and essentially "Japanese" feudal period&#x2014;with two rulers, an emperor and a Shogun&#x2014;which was to last until the nineteenth century. Under the Togukawa shogunate (1600-1868), Chinese culture enjoyed something of a renaissance, though popular culture owed more to Japanese urban taste and urban wealth.<br><br>In 1868 the Meiji Restoration brought to power rulers dedicated to the pursuit of national wealth and strength, and Japan became a world power. Although a bid for empire ended in disaster, the years after 1945 saw an economic miracle that brought spectacular wealth to Japan and the Japanese people, as well as the westernization of much of Japanese life.</p><p>In the late ninth century, a Japanese scholar of Chinese literature named Sugawara Michizane received an unexpected promotion from on high: the emperor appointed the outstanding young commoner to the Council of State, "an advancement," author W.G. Beasley writes, "almost unheard of for one of his birth." The emperor apparently wanted Michizane to help him in an intrigue against a rival family, but the emperor's plot failed. The emperor was deposed, and Michizane went into exile to Kyushu, where he died in 903. After his death, storms and earthquakes, events attributed to Michizane's ghost, struck the imperial capital.<p> The story of Sugawara Michizane, a footnote in a long epic of interfamilial struggle, illustrates several of the problems scholars of premodern Japanese history face. For one, important actions were directed by members of the imperial household, who took pains to conceal their motives. For another, actors in the historical record tend to appear and disappear quickly from the scene. For still another, that record is shot through with mythology and, in Beasley's words, "distortions of fact and chronology." Beasley ably negotiates these considerable difficulties, taking pains to distinguish conjecture from fact as he unfolds a sweeping chronicle of Japanese history. Covering a period of 30,000 years, Beasley's book stands among the best one-volume histories of Japan, accessible to general readers and scholars alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>W.G.

Ross worries about everything from keeping track of office typewriters to the magazine&#39;s role in wartime to the exact questions to be asked for a &#34;Talk of the Town&#34; piece on the song &#34;Happy Birthday.&#34; We find Ross, in Kunkel&#39;s words, &#34;scolding Henry Luce, lecturing Orson Welles, baiting J. Edgar Hoover, inviting Noel Coward and Ginger Rogers to the circus, wheedling Ernest Hemingway-- offering to sell Harpo Marx a used car and James Cagney a used tractor, and explaining to restaurateur-to-the-stars Dave Chasen, step by step, how to smoke a turkey.&#34; These letters from a supreme editor tell in his own words the story of the fierce, lively man who launched the world&#39;s most prestigious magazine.</p><p>"Don't waste your time and words on letters," Harold Ross cautioned more than one writer. "You don't get paid for them." Happily, <i>The New Yorker</i>'s founding editor and dreamer didn't follow his own advice, and now--thanks to his biographer, Thomas Kunkel--we can share in Ross's revealing, inspiring, and hilarious correspondence. The fizzing communiqu�s collected in <i>Letters from the Editor</i> begin when he was a serviceman in France during World War I, and from the start his impulses were comedic. In April 1918, for example, a shell came a little too close for comfort: "My morale was shattered. I immediately retreated to a subway station and remained there for two hours. I then came up and consumed a whole bottle of 'morale.'"<p> Ross liked to present himself as an unadorned, uneducated type, but from the moment he magicked up <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1924, it's clear that he was far more. Nonetheless, as late as 1949 he declared, "I don't know anything I've done for the human race, except possibly entertain a minute segment of it from time to time, and I can't compare myself with Goethe, because I don't know what he did for the race, either." The above quotes should give readers some notion of Ross's zinging mode, his sentences gathering into an absurd or satirical finale. Here's another: In 1937, he told E.B. White: "A gentleman from Montreal wrote in suggesting that your last piece be set to music. I suppose you got that letter. There was some talk that I ought to write you a letter upon completion of ten years service and I started a couple of times on it, my idea being to have <i>that</i> set to music and sing it to you." And the paragraph only gets better from there--just take a look at page 120. In fact, Ross's dispatches to White and White's wife, <i>New Yorker</i> editor Katharine White, are among the book's most tantalizing as he wheedles, exclaims, scolds, and invigorates.</p><p> Ross lived for his job, and gave endless support to his writers, artists, and editors. His letters to the likes of Fitzgerald, Thurber, Rebecca West--not to mention the various Marx brothers--are graceful and unsycophantic. Yet he was no less solicitous to the obscure. In 1949 he complimented one Sally Benson on her "very good and trim story" before admonishing her: "Twenty-six stories in the next twenty-six weeks is what I expect from you, young lady, and come to think of it no more suicides during that period. Our characters have been bumping themselves off so often lately that our readers think they're reading <i>Official Detective</i> half the time."</p><p> Of course <i>Letters from the Editor</i> lets us in on far more than <i>The New Yorker</i>, but it is Ross's missives and memos to his staff and contributors--and several more than acrimonious shots at his publisher and advertising department--that are most intriguing. Here was an editor who was concerned with every level of the magazine: he kept a card catalog with story ideas but was equally obsessed with language, commas, typos, and even the vexed question of large or small capital letters. In this sense, Kunkel's collection is a sublime record of a lost era. Ross was a lucky visionary, after all, who never concerned himself with target audiences, focus groups, or user testing. By his own lights, he and his colleagues were not "'aware' of our readers. It's the other way around with me. All I know about getting out a magazine is to print what you think is good ... and let nature take its course: if enough readers think as you do, you're a success, if not you're a failure. I don't think it's possible to edit a magazine by 'doping out' your audience, and would never try to do that." Hmmm, could Harold Ross have something there? <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Thomas Kunkel is the author of a biography of Ross, Genius in Disguise, and Enormous Prayers.

He stars in one of the nicest gift books." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect for everyone who loves yoga or elephants - a NEW Babar book Well before yoga became fashionable via Sting and Madonna, our friend Babar and all the residents of Celesteville were finding peace and tranquillity through yoga. And now elephants everywhere can join them! Through easy-to-follow instructions and step-by-step illustrations, <i>Babar's Yoga for Elephants</i> presents 15 positions and stretches as well as helpful breathing exercises. The book also provides useful advice on what to do with your trunk while in position, a dilemma that human yoga books often ignore. Written by Babar himself, the book explains how yoga was introduced to Celesteville and how he and Celeste keep fit doing yoga on their many travels. <i>Babar's Yoga for Elephants</i> is&nbsp;a classic for elephants as well as their human friends.</p><p>Laurent de Brunhoff has kept the spirit of Babar and his family alive for more than 50 years. He practices yoga every day. He and his wife, author Phyllis Rose, divide their time among Key West, New York City, and Connecticut.Grade 2-4-Babar confides that even elephants experience stress in their day-to-day living, and a little yoga, it seems, goes a long way in providing comfort and relaxation. In fact, the book starts out by revealing that little clay cylinders found in a cave near Celesteville prove that elephants invented yoga. This find was authenticated at the National Library, where elephants, together with human yoga experts, "discovered that all of the poses depicted on the seals are still practiced today." Spreads feature instructional text on one side, with Babar illustrating the poses on the other. After introducing yoga to Celesteville, Babar and Celeste go on a worldwide jaunt where they practice their favorite yoga positions in front of famous landmarks. The Proud Warrior is demonstrated in front of the Eiffel Tower, the Bridge is practiced in front of the Half Dome in Yosemite, and, because "the traffic in Times Square is terrible," the Lotus position returns Babar's and Celeste's minds to Celesteville. While the art style is reminiscent of the original books, the colors are far more subdued. A note at the end reminds children that "this book is intended for elephants interested in yoga," and that "humans and other animals should consult books written specifically with them in mind." The book includes a large, removable poster. Babar's Yoga would be useful for larger collections needing information on the subject.<br><i>Lisa Gangemi Kropp, Middle Country Public Library, Centereach, NY</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Harold Robbins: Three Complete Novels- The Carpetbaggers / 79 Park Avenue / A Stone for Danny Fisher</h2><p>A collection of best-selling novels from one of the best-selling novelists of all time includes 79 Park Avenue, The Carpetbaggers, and A Stone for Danny Fisher.</p><p></p><h2>Loose Change: Quilts from Nickels, Dimes, and Fat Quarters</h2><p><p>Finally, a book to use with all those great precut fabric collections!

Levine Books / Scholastic.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;This humorous picture book requires a total suspension of disbelief. The premise that a man wearing Western clothing and sitting in a saloon does not know what to do with a saddle he receives for his birthday is delightfully silly. The instructions that accompany the gift advise him to "1. Find a horse 2. Enjoy the ride." However, the man does not know what a horse is so he asks a red wagon, "Are you a horse?" "'Nope, I'm an old wagon,' said the wagon. 'A horse is a <i>living</i> thing.'" He asks a cactus the same question, and it replies, "I bristle at the thought! I'm a cactus. A horse is an animal." Then he queries various animals absurdly found in the same habitat: a snake, a crab, a lion, and a zebra. The crab declares, "I'll pinch you good! A horse is friendly. I'm a crab! NOW GO AWAY!" The conclusion delivers a big chuckle. The gouache and India ink illustrations are comical and colorful, and the cartoon expressions capture the burlesque nature of the story. There are some clever visual interpretations. One series of six panels conveys the lengthy passage of time that it takes for a sloth to give his answer.

The Unraveling of America, he says, &#34;was intended as a cautionary tale for liberals in the hope that when their hour struck again, they might perhaps be fortified against past error.

Looking at three ancient texts, she explores the historic background and theological and cultural questions that the documents raise. <p>"<i>The Gospel of Mary</i>" is a humbly told story of the Virgin's life from her conception to the birth of Jesus, put into written form as early as A.D. 150. The second text is a brief prayer to Mary found in Egypt on a scrap of papyrus and dated to the following century. It is the oldest known prayer to Mary. The third text, "The Annunciation Hymn of Rejoicing," was written by the Syrian poet Romanos in about A.D. 520 and is considered one of the finest examples of Eastern Christian poetry. This graceful hymn is still sung in Eastern Orthodox churches throughout the world today. </p><p>Warmly devout, historically detailed, and rich with spiritual applications for today, The Lost Gospel of Mary is the latest gem from Frederica Mathewes-Green. The fruit of her whole-hearted faith and careful study is an intimate glimpse of the extraordinary mother of our Lord.</p>Come to know the mother of Jesus as the early Christians once did. <p>Mary is the flower of femininity to some, a woman of power to others. She has been seen as a paragon of obedience, as well as an instrument of liberation. Some have piled her status so high that it rivals that of her Son. Others do their best to ignore her entirely. Behind all of these images there is still a girl who grew up to become the mother of Christ. </p><p>How did the first Christians view Mary? What were the commonly understood facts about Mary's early life--before the Annunciation? Frederica Mathewes-Green opens up Mary's life before the Nativity, offering a window into her centrality to Christian faith in new and sometimes startling ways.</p></p><h2>Magic Dogs of the Volcanoes: Los Perros Magicos De Los Volcanes (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>When the magic dogs who live on the volcanoes of El Salvador and protect the villagers from harm are pursued by wicked lead soldiers, they are aided by two ancient volcanoes.</p><p>Text: English, SpanishKindergarten-Grade 3-- For generations, the cadejos , wolflike, magical animals, have cared for the people who live at the foot of the volcanoes. But then the landowner decides to do away with them in the hopes of making the campesinos harder working, and he sends soldiers made out of lead to kill them. In desperation the cadejos call upon their great-great grandparents, the volcanoes, who defeat the soldiers, and, by extension, the landowner. In this engagingly told dual-language story from El Salvador, the original Spanish text is much smoother and more dynamic than is the English translation, which misses some of the humor and clever turns of speech that grace Arguenta's narrative form. However, the translation is able and reads aloud well enough to hold the attention of young listeners. Simmons's illustrations are in keeping with the folkloric tone. Large, bright, and primitive-looking, they have some of the mass and volume of Orozco's work. Paired with Jane Anne Volkmer's Song of the Chirimia (Carolrhoda, 1990), this opens listeners to the folklore of Central America in an attractively illustrated, accessible form. --Ann Welton, University Child Development School, Seattle<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Delog: Journey to Realms Beyond Death</h2><p>This vivid personal account of a journey through the &#34;bardos&#34; and &#34;pure realms&#34; was recorded by 16-year-old Dawa Drolma of Eastern Tibet, a renowned female lama and a &#34;delog&#34;-one who crosses the threshold of death and returns to tell about it. What she saw during her five days of travel through other realms engendered in her a limitless compassion for sentient beings.</p><p>Dawa Drolma, one of the great Vajrayana Buddhist lamas of the century and mother of Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, lived in Kham in Eastern Tibet. At the age of 16 she fell ill and died, but returned to her body after five days and lived into her 30&#39;s. For the benefit of others she recorded every detail of her experiences in the bardo and pure realms. Her daughter, T&#39;hrinlay Wangmo, preserved the diary until 1987, when Chagdud Rinpoche brought it out of Chinese-occupied Tibet to be published in the West.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Tibetan</p><h2>The Te of Piglet (Wisdom of Pooh)</h2><p><b><i>The Te of Piglet</i> . . . in which a good deal of Taoist wisdom is revealed through the character and actions of A. A. Milne's Piglet</b>. Piglet? Yes, Piglet. For the better than impulsive Tigger? or the gloomy Eeyore? or the intellectual Owl? or even the lovable Pooh? Piglet herein demonstrates a very important principle of Taoism: The Te--a Chinese word meaning Virtue--of the Small.&nbsp;<b>Happy 90th birthday (October 14th), to one of the world's most beloved icons of &nbsp;literature, Winnie-the-Pooh!&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Benjamin Hoff </b>grew up in a rural area a few miles from Portland, Oregon. As a child, he preferred to spend his time outdoors, observing animals, insects, and plants. And from an early age he&nbsp;loved to write. He is also the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller<b>&nbsp;<b>The Tao of Pooh&nbsp;</b></b>and<b><b>&nbsp;The Diary of Opal Whiteley.</b></b>Ten years later, a sequel to the runaway bestseller The Tao of Pooh. If you like marshmallow laced with arsenic, it was worth the wait. In the original, as you may recall, Hoff had an Idea: that Winnie-the-Pooh could be used to explain Taoism, the ancient Chinese way of balance. Now, as luck would have it, Pooh's buddy Piglet turns out to be the perfect embodiment of Te, the Taoist term for virtue, which is attained through sensitivity, modesty, and smallness. Piglet, you see, is a ``Very Small Animal'' (for all his talk about smallness, Hoff, like A.A. Milne, who must be groaning in his grave, likes capital letters Very Much), and the diminutive porker's adventures are the perfect means to preach, Very Lightly, about being positive and ecological and upright. The trick is to ``observe, deduce, apply''; once done, the millennial ``Day of Piglet'' will arrive and human beings will once again achieve ``the state of paradise that existed before the Great Separation occurred.'' Watch out, though: All is not summer in the 100-Acre Wood. Beneath the goofy grin one finds bared teeth, as Hoff snaps away peevishly at Confucianism (``authoritarian, No- Nonsense attitude toward life''), Christianity, feminism (``behind their antimasculine words, it's Overmasculinity as Usual''), Republicans, critics, computers--whatever raises his Taoist hackles. All in a Good Cause, of course. No doubt, The Ching of Eeyore comes next. Then what? Well, by then the Day of Piglet will have come, and the whole world will be a Trillion-Acre Wood...so empty your pockets while you can, and watch Piglet bring home the bacon.

And in the uneasy weeks that follow, the survivors of the holocaust continue to be tested to the limits of their endurance. <br> <br> But strange and mysterious occurrences are destabilizing the galaxy's battle-weary Allies even further. In the Federation, efforts to replenish diminished resources and give succor to millions of evacuees are thwarted at every turn.

Sonek Pran -- teacher, diplomat, and sometime adviser to the Federation President -- perceives a pattern in the seeming randomness.

In this volume of advanced teachings, Gampopa passes on these same instructions in the form of heart advice on how to practice the nature of mind and reach enlightenment. <br><br>Ringu Tulku&#x2019;s commentary on the text, taken from his own community talks to students in Europe and America, makes Gampopa&#x2019;s teaching&nbsp; wonderfully accessible. His gentleness, warmth, and humor, as well as his wisdom and practicality, shine through in his own heartfelt advice on how we too could transform confusion into wisdom.</p><p>Ringu Tulku Rinpoche was born in Kham Lingtsang, in eastern Tibet, and was recognized by His Holiness the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa as the incarnation of one of the tulkus of Ringu monastery, a Kagy�pa monastery in his home province. He studied with some of the most distinguished khenpos of the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions and received teachings from many outstanding masters, including Thrangu Rinpoche, Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and the Gyalwang Karmapa. He is also the author of <i>Path to Buddhahood</i> and <i>The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul.</i>&#x201c;I am pleased that Ringu Tulku has chosen to share in Gampopa&#x2019;s spirit of offering the Dharma, in publishing this translation and commentary on Gampopa&#x2019;s Great Community Talks. I am confident that the coming together of these two&#x2014;root text and commentary, Gampopa and Ringu Tulku&#x2014;will be a source of goodness in the world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the Seventeenth Karmapa <br><br>&#x201c;Pithy and to the point, Gampopa&#x2019;s heart advice to his assembly captures in poetic fashion the importance of seeing the mind as it is, recognizing pitfalls along the path, visualizing the tantric deity, and listening to the dharma. Much of his advice is directed toward experienced meditators in retreat, and though Gampopa&#x2019;s verses on the intricacies of meditation are concentrated, Ringu Tulka adds water with his stories and commentary, making these teachings vibrant and refreshing for practitioners of Mahamudra.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Buddhadharma: The Practitioner&#x2019;s Quarterly</i></p><h2>The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time</h2><p>The first volume of the bestselling Gonzo Papers</p><p>"The Washington Post"<p>He amuses; he frightens; he flirts with doom.

She be-friended Rainer Maria Rilke and inspired the young James Joyce, who kept a portrait of her on his desk. Her greatest love, the poet d&#x2019;Annunzio, made her the heroine of his novel Il fuoco (The Flame). She radically changed the art of acting: in a duel between the past and the future, she vanquished her rival, Sarah Bernhardt. Chekhov said of her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like it. Looking at Duse, I realized why the Russian theatre is such a bore.&#x201d; Charlie Chaplin called her &#x201c;the finest thing I have seen on the stage.&#x201d; Gloria Swanson and Lillian Gish watched her perform with adoring attention, John Barrymore with awe. Shaw said she &#x201c;touches you straight on the very heart.&#x201d;<br><br>When asked about her acting, Duse responded that, quite simply, it came from life. Except for one short film, Duse&#x2019;s art has been lost. Despite dozens of books about her, her story is muffled by legend and myth. The sentimental image that prevails is of a misty, tragic heroine victimized by men, by life; an artist of unearthly purity, without ambition. <br><br>Now Helen Sheehy, author of the much admired biography of Eva Le Gallienne, gives us a different Duse&#x2014;a woman of strength and resolve, a woman who knew pain but could also inflict it. &#x201c;Life is hard,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;one must wound or be wounded.&#x201d; She wanted to reveal on the stage the truth about women&#x2019;s lives and she wanted her art to endure. <br><br>Drawing on newly discovered material, including Duse&#x2019;s own memoir, and unpublished letters and notes, Sheehy brings us to an understanding of the great actress&#x2019;s unique ways of working: Duse acting out of her sense of her character&#x2019;s inner life, Duse anticipating the bold aspects of modernism and performing with a sexual freedom that shocked and thrilled audiences. She edited her characters&#x2019; lines to bare skeletons, asked for the simplest sets and costumes. Where other actresses used hysterics onstage, Duse used stillness.<br><br>Sheehy writes about the Duse that the actress herself tried to hide&#x2014;tracing her life from her childhood as a performing member of a family of actors touring their repertory of drama and commedia dell&#x2019;arte through Italy. We follow her through her twenties and through the next four decades of commissioning and directing plays, running her own company, and illuminating a series of great roles that included Emile Zola&#x2019;s Th�r�se Raquin, Marguerite in Dumas&#x2019;s La Dame aux cam�lias, Nora in Ibsen&#x2019;s A Doll&#x2019;s House, and Hedda in his Hedda Gabler. When she thought her beauty was fading at fifty-one, she gave up the stage, only to return to the theatre in her early sixties; she traveled to America and enchanted audiences across the country. She died as she was born&#x2014;on tour.<br><br>Sheehy&#x2019;s illuminating book brings us as close as we have ever been to the woman and the artist.</p><p>Helen Sheehy is the author of <b>Eva Le Gallienne: A Biography</b>; <b>Margo: The Life and Theatre of Margo Jones</b>; and <b>All About Theatre</b>. She lives in Hamden, Connecticut.Chapter 1<br><br>Who calls? I am here. What is your will?" Repeating the lines of Shakespeare's Juliet, Eleonora Giulia Amalia Duse walked through the Palio gates into Verona on a Sunday in May 1873. She was fourteen. Slender and small-waisted, she moved with easy strides, using her whole body as one accustomed to walking great distances. Her long dark hair was shot through with bronze strands highlighted by the sun. In repose, her striking features-large, heavy-lidded black eyes, high, broad cheekbones over a square jaw, a patrician nose, and generous mouth-suggested the purity of classic sculpture.<br><br>Already a stage veteran of ten years, Eleonora was the leading lady in her family's troupe, a struggling, itinerant theatre company engaged to perform Romeo and Juliet that afternoon in Verona's ancient arena. As she walked, Eleonora rehearsed her lines that she had copied into a notebook. "I was choked with anxiety," she recalled.<br><br>Juliet, she imagined, had walked these same streets of swirling gray stones, looked up at the same red-roofed buildings, visited the same palazzi of local pink limestone, rosso di Verona. Perhaps Juliet had crossed the Scaligero bridge by the old castle and gazed into the depths of the Adige, which wound like a ribbon through the city. The sun bathed everything in glowing light, but at each street corner Eleonora expected to see a sombre funeral procession and Juliet's iron coffin.<br><br>In the Piazza Erbe, which had served as a market for almost two thousand years, Eleonora made her way through the stands shaded by white umbrellas. She stopped by the splashing Roman fountain with its statue of a woman<br><br>representing Verona. Using all of her money, she bought pale pink roses. They would serve as a prop for Juliet-an idea suggested by her parents' first meeting, a family story her father, Alessandro Duse, had recorded in his diary. One day, walking along a street, he had felt flowers and leaves rain down upon him. He had looked up and into the eyes of a dark-haired girl tending her window box. Day after day, he followed the same path until he found the courage to walk up the stairs to her balcony. Finally, he did speak to her, and they married. Eleonora's mother's name was Angelica Cappelletto, which sounded hauntingly similar to Capulet.<br><br> From the Piazza Erbe to the arena was a short ten-minute walk. Finished by the Romans in the first century a.d., the arena could hold 25,000 people, almost half the population of Verona, in unbroken stone tiers of rosso di Verona. Throughout the centuries, the vast stone oval had hosted gladiator fights, mock sea battles, bullfights, fairs, equestrian performances, and grand opera. Small theatre companies like the Duse-Lagunaz troupe set up their wooden stage-their two planks and a passion-at one end of the arena, roped off a section of the seats, and charged only a few pennies for the late-afternoon performances.<br><br>Entering into the sunlit arena from the shadowy, underground corridors, Eleonora looked up at the tall grasses that grew from the crumbling parapet. A breeze stirred, and she felt her energy rise. Intoxicated by the fever of her imagination, the clear light, the dark blue sky, and the scent of the rose bouquet she carried, "the words flowed with strange ease, almost spontaneously," she remembered, "and I could hear them through the constant drumming of my heartbeat."<br><br>During the performance that day, when Juliet first met Romeo at the<br><br>ball, Eleonora allowed one of her roses to drop at his feet. Later, from her balcony, she plucked the petals one by one from a rose, as if she were laying bare her heart, and they floated down to him. As the tragedy neared its end, the sun began to set, turning the top stone tier a fiery red. Under a "sky white as pearl," Eleonora heard the bells of the churches of Verona and "that almost sea-sound which quieted when I appeared." Mingling love with death, she covered Romeo, who lay in the tomb, with the last of her roses, and they wilted in the heat. When she stabbed herself with Romeo's dagger and fell upon his body, "the crowd let out such a great roar that I was terrified."<br><br>Struck by the coincidence of playing a girl of her same age in Juliet's own city, and acting as Juliet herself might have acted, Eleonora believed she was the reincarnation of Shakespeare's character. Before she spoke, every word seemed "to go right through the heat of my blood. There was not a fibre in me that did not contribute to the harmony. Oh, grace, it was a state of grace!"<br><br>In this state of boundless grace, she felt an "indescribable sense of abandonment." "Someone lifted me up," she recalled. "They held the torch close to my tear-stained face; it was crackling very loudly, it smelled of resin and was red and black with flames and smoke."<br><br>"I was Juliet," she explained. "I must have looked like death itself."<br><br>In becoming Juliet, Eleonora Duse found herself. The feeling that surged through her, undoing the boundaries of her personality and uniting her in communion with the audience, was terrifying, uncanny, and as ancient as Dionysus, the god of the theatre, who embodies two opposing principles, the "ecstasy of power over others and the ecstasy of self-surrender." For the rest of her life, because she became most herself when acting other selves, she would seek this state of profound grace and ecstatic abandonment. "Art, like love," she said, "is insatiable."<br><br>Guided, she said, by a secret voice, a voice she called an "echo of the pain of the world," Duse aimed for a "transformation of life." Her grandfather Luigi Duse had taken off the traditional commedia dell'arte mask to reveal his human face. Eleonora Duse freed herself from the superficial mask of stage makeup and then she stripped away another mask. She opened her soul and revealed a woman as a human being. Her singular journey revolutionized the theatre and our understanding of what it means to be human. Duse's art embodied the past, the exact present, and the future. She was the first modern actor.<br><br>Speaking in Italian in theatres around the world, Duse was understood. Audiences, critics, and especially other artists were moved and responded to her art with acclamations and an outpouring of tributes at times so extreme as to be worthy of a deity. Critics scoured their vocabularies for words to describe her acting and yet words seemed inadequate. How could they describe what they had never seen before?<br><br>In the characters she portrayed-and she acted women only-Duse expanded the very idea of Woman. With sprezzatura, a seemingly effortless grace, she revealed the immense gap between accepted ideas of woman and what a woman really was. Once, she was told that in Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, she was acting the drama of the female spirit. "No!" she replied, "the drama of everyone." Because she believed that language, the very words themselves, were ambiguous, cloudy, and contradictory, she ransacked her scripts, digging beneath the lines of her characters not to reveal certainty, but to portray what she called the invisible side of life. Duse's humanistic art<br><br>and her revolutionary approach to language anticipated the complexity, fluidity, and impermanence of the modern world. In Duse's acting, as in her personality, there was nothing fixed, no national boundaries, no boundaries at all-there was only a human being, alive, ever changing, and ultimately tragic.<br><br>The world of the theatre, an active, ephemeral world that moves from light into darkness, is a metaphor for life-and death-itself. Duse understood this. After seeing her work, Konstantin Stanislavsky sought to codify her art. Duse rejected theories of art and "dared not define" her own art. While Stanislavsky sought a method to reproduce the character night after night, Duse aimed for something more. She strived to create a new woman, a new human being, in performance after performance. "Through discipline," she wrote, "with incessant control, with incessant self-domination, and squandering one's own person and soul to become a consciousness . . . to conjure from the center and journey to the most secret heart of things, not the reality of life, but the dream." Like Donatello, she wanted her art to be a new language: "the outward rendered expressive of the inward; the body instinct with spirit; the soul made incarnate."<br><br>She resisted all efforts to dissect her art. When the first biography was published about her, she wouldn't read it because she believed an academic could never understand her. Urged endlessly to write her autobiography, she refused. Except for some scribbled pages of memories, she never wrote a memoir. Unsentimental about her life, she refused to turn it into publicity or mythology. Experience had taught her fame was enhanced by mystery, and privacy created more fascination than self-promotion.<br><br>At twenty-four, with two decades of acting behind her, when pushed by a persistent critic to explain her art, Duse offered a parable instead. As a child she had been given a beautiful puppet. Intrigued by the puppet's moving arms and legs and smiling mouth that opened and closed, she had destroyed it when she took it apart to see how it was made. "And it's art that you wish to talk about?" she chided the critic. "It would be like trying to explain love." Those "who pretend to understand art, understand nothing," she told him bluntly. Years later, she wondered, "Who is it that arrives at art without an understanding of life?"<br><br>After she had become an international celebrity, Duse was asked which country she preferred. "The crossing," she replied. When Duse was born she had no country, and the journey would always be more important to her than any nation. The image of the sea flows through her writing. She grew up near water-the Adriatic, the lagoons ...</p><h2>Kodak Girl: from the Martha Cooper Collection</h2><p>This book tells the remarkable story of the Kodak Girl, one of the most durable and successful marketing campaigns in advertising history. Created by George Eastman, inventor of the inexpensive hand-held camera, the Kodak Girl traces the intersection of American culture with photography as it evolved from a studio-bound practice to a snapshot obsession for the masses. Martha Cooper's extensive collection of Kodak Girl material ranges from advertising, by Kodak and other camera manufacturers, to photographs from all periods, engravings, trading cards, matchbooks as well as commemorative stamps and Valentine's Days cards. This rich collection considers the relationship of the Kodak Girl to the birth of the snapshot during the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries, and is accompanied by two essays on the seminal role of women - on both sides of the camera - in photography's early history.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Manjiro: The Boy Who Risked His Life for Two Countries</h2><p><p>In 1841, Japan had been closed to the outside world for 250 years, and anyone who tried to return to the country after leaving it could be executed. So when the small fishing boat on which fourteen-year-old Manjiro was working was shipwrecked, he despaired of ever returning to his village. The captain of the American whaling ship that rescued Manjiro took a special interest in him, inviting him to come live in Massachusetts. There, Manjiro was treated like Captain Whitfield's son, and he began to feel as though Massachusetts was his second home. Still, he never gave up his dream of finding a way to return to Japan and see his mother again. </p><p>Watercolor illustrations bring to life the true story of a determined and resourceful young man whose intimate knowledge of two cultures later led him to play an important role in the opening of Japan to Western trade and ideas. </p><p><i>Manjiro</i> is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p>EMILY ARNOLD MCCULLY, a Caldecott Medalist, has written and illustrated many children's books, including <i>Marvelous Mattie </i>and <i>Squirrel and John Muir</i>, both NCSS-CBC Notable Children's Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies, and, most recently, <i>The Escape of Oney Judge. </i>She divides her time between New York City and upstate New York.</p>Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;A fascinating episode from Japanese history, related in an oversize picture-book format. In 1841, while 14-year-old Manjiro and four men were fishing, their small boat was destroyed in a storm, and they were cast away on a tiny island for almost six months. Though they survived a drought and an earthquake, they feared for their lives. "For over two and a half centuries Japan had been closed to the outside world. Anyone who tried to return after leaving the country could be put to death." They were finally rescued by a New England whaling ship. At journey's end, Captain Whitfield took Manjiro home to New Bedford, MA. Whitfield married and bought a farm where the boy learned to plant, cultivate, harvest, and ride a horse&#x2014;a skill reserved for samurai in Japan. Despite increasing homesickness, he attended school and graduated at the top of his class. In 1849, the California gold rush lured him to San Francisco where he collected $600 in gold dust in 70 days. Finally, after a nine-year absence, he headed back to Japan with two of the original castaways. When they arrived, government officials jailed and questioned them for seven months. He told them of America's desire to trade and of railroads, telegraphs, drawbridges, and wristwatches. At last, he became an honored samurai. An author's note gives background on Japan's 250-year isolationist policy and how one curious, determined boy opened the door to the Western world. McCully's realistic watercolors are striking against white backgrounds and show the contrast between traditional Japanese and 19th-century New Englanders as well as the tumultuous seas and perils of a fishing life.

This story offers critical lessons for a society traumatized by political divides and facing the looming catastrophe of global climate change.<br> <br> Author Riki Ott, a rare combination of commercial salmon &#x201c;fisherm&#x2019;am&#x201d; and PhD marine biologist, describes firsthand the impacts of oil companies&#x2019; broken promises when the Exxon Valdez spills most of its cargo and despoils thousands of miles of shore. Ott illustrates in stirring fashion the oil industry&#x2019;s 20-year trail of pollution and deception that predated the tragic 1989 spill and delves deep into the disruption to the fishing community of Cordova over the following 19 years. In vivid detail, she describes the human trauma coupled inextricably with that of the sound&#x2019;s wildlife and its long road to recovery.<br> <br> Ott critically examines shifts in scientific understanding of oil-spill effects on ecosystems and communities, exposes fundamental flaws in governance and the legal system, and contrasts hard won spill-prevention and spill-response measures in the sound to dangerous conditions on the Alaska pipeline. Her human story, varied background, professional training, and activist heart lead readers to the root of the problem: a clash of human rights and corporate power embedded in law and small-town life.<br> <br> <em>Not One Drop</em> is as much an example of how too many corporate owners and political leaders betray everyday citizens as it is one of the universal struggle to maintain heart, to find the courage to overcome disaster, and to forge a new path from despair to hope.</p></p><p>Marine oil pollution expert Riki Ott, PhD, was on the scene before, during, and after one of the biggest environmental disasters in the United States--the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A former commercial salmon &#34;fisherma&#39;am&#34; in Prince William Sound, she experienced firsthand the spill&#39;s effects, including environmental devastation, economic losses to the fishing industry, and psychosocial trauma to the close-knit community. 1993&#39;s spill-related salmon- and herring-population collapses prompted Ott to retire from fishing and found three nonprofit organizations to deal with the area&#39;s lingering social, economic, and environmental harm. A popular and dynamic lecturer, her talks weave the legacy of the Exxon Valdez spill into current issues of public health, environmental pollution, and our energy future--and inspire individuals to take action.<p>&#x201c;As you read the following pages, allow your heart to break. Imagine Cordova as your home and Prince William Sound as your backyard. When you set the book down, make an absolute, iron-clad commitment to join other men and women who are determined to create a world that future generations will want to inhabit.&#x201d;<strong>-<em>-</em>John Perkins, from the Foreword</strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly-</em></strong><br>Ott, a former Prince William Sound fisherman and longtime activist around the Exxon Valdez Alaska oil spill of 1989, pours plenty of passion into this exhaustive account of the financial and psychological toll on the residents of Cordova, the town most affected by the disaster. Her book is a scathing indictment of Exxon's take-no-prisoners legal roadblocks. She enumerates the full horror of the spill's aftermath: the 1989 loss of $50 million in fishery revenue, a botched cleanup effort, the onslaught of oil-company lobbyists and continuing fish habitat degradation. Ott focuses on Cordova's struggle to rebuild a sense of community while coping with personal bankruptcies and failing marriages, and covers the legal skirmishing for compensation for the more than 3,000 fishermen who filed claims, closing with a melancholy coda following the Supreme Court's decision to reduce the original jury award against Exxon from more than $5 billion to about $500 million--"devastating news" for those "whose lives entered a state of turmoil some 19 years ago." Though Ott's narrative is often bogged down with too much detail, she covers an enormous amount of ground with engaging humanity.<br></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Choice-</em></strong><br><em>Not One Drop</em> is a gripping story of what happened in Cordova, a small fishing village of some 2,500 people, as a result of the 4.11 million gallons of oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez tanker into Prince William Sound on March 14, 1989. Developed from interviews with townspeople, state and federal officials, and politicians, this book describes a classic case of the worst of commercialism versus the best of environmentalism, with the former aided and abetted by those with vested interests. Beginning with a description of marine biologist Ott's idyllic but demanding life in commercial fishing, the four subsequent parts of the work, "Promises," "Betrayal," "Courage," and "New Beginnings," provide a comprehensive inventory of the events that devastated the social fabric of Cordova. The superbly detailed "Timeline" covers the 1968 discovery of oil on the Alaska North Slope up to the June 25, 2008, Supreme Court decision limiting punitive damages from the spill. The book includes color photographs of happy and sad times as well as ones showing oil-slicked waterfowl and humans, many of whom suffered from a respiratory condition known as "Valdez Crud." Detailed listing of supporting notes and excellent index. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels of readership.<br></p><br><br><p>"Millions of words have been written about the Exxon Valdez spill. It's been my (sometimes dreary and depressing) duty to read most of them. But of all the official reports, learned papers, TV documentaries, newspaper articles and books, this is by far the best. Riki has written her masterpiece. It's not just about an oil spill and about its dire effects on a community of a few thousand fishing families in a remote and beautiful corner of the North Pacific; it's bigger than that. The themes are community values and corporate lies; the endless tussle between truth and falsehood, between good and evil.Surprisingly, Riki's long-awaited book is more cheerful than I expected; she meticulously logs the catastrophe and its aftermath (and hints at the sacrifices in her personal life that all this campaigning entailed), but out of the despair there is hope here--hope that a better-informed, more vigilant and more self-confident public will follow her example and challenge the corporate arrogance that continues to make so many people's lives an avoidable misery, worldwide."<strong>--Dr. Jonathan Wills, writer, wildlife guide, and Shetland (Scotland) Councillor</strong><br></p><br><br><p>"Riki Ott, a modern day Joan of Arc, was in the right place at the right time to become witness to one of the most egregious crimes against man and nature in modern day history.

Her expertise as an author and as a marine toxicologist alerts us to the true cost of our addiction to oil--not just monetary cost, but ecological cost. Democracy and the planet are at stake."<strong>--Nina Bradley, Director of the Aldo Leopold Foundation</strong><br></p><br><br><p>"Ott is the Erin Brockovitch of the Exxon Valdez oil disaster. In <em>Not One Drop</em> she recounts a riveting tale of loss, intrigue, cover-ups, and courage--and in the process helps us all see why we will be glad to leave behind the age of oil."<strong>--Fran Korten, Publisher of <em>YES!</em> Magazine</strong><br></p><br><br><p>"Riki Ott takes the debate on fossil fuels to a new level in this compelling book. When will the oil companies wake up to realize that--just as U.S. car companies missed the boat on fuel efficient cars--the ExxonMobils of the world need to diversify the types of energy they offer? Somehow, the people of Cordova, Alaska, knew the truth before the oil executives or the politicians they elected."<strong>--David Rockefeller, Jr., Founder, Sailors for the Sea</strong><br></p><br><br><p>"<em>Not One Drop</em> unflinchingly documents the full measure of sacrifice made by a few so the rest of us can get our next fix of oil. The price at the pump must now also be measured in shattered communities and our humanity itself.

I was not cut out for this, wasn&#x2019;t like many of the other women on the crew, my movements were often too heavy-handed. I lacked the subtle motor skills and precision required. This wasn&#x2019;t what I was made for, but all the same I had to be here, every single day, twelve hours a day.<br> <br>The trees were as old as a lifetime. The branches were as fragile as thin glass, they cracked beneath our weight. I twisted myself carefully, mustn&#x2019;t damage the tree. I placed my right foot on a branch even further up, and carefully pulled the left up behind it. And finally I found a secure working position, uncomfortable but stable. From here I could reach the uppermost flowers.<br> <br>The little plastic container was full of the gossamer gold, carefully weighed out. I tried to transfer invisible portions lightly out of the container and over into the trees. Each individual blossom was to be dusted with the tiny brush of hen feathers, from hens scientifically cultivated for precisely this purpose. No feathers of artificial fibers had proven nearly as effective. It had been tested, and then tested again, because we had had plenty of time&#x2014;in my district the tradition of hand pollination was more than a hundred years old. The bees here had disappeared back in the 1980s, long before The Collapse; pesticides had done away with them. A few years later, when the pesticides were no longer in use, the bees returned, but by then hand pollination had already been implemented. The results were better, even though an incredible number of people, an incredible number of hands were required. And so, when The Collapse came, my district had a competitive edge. It had paid off to be the ones who polluted the most. We were a pioneer nation in pollution and so we became a pioneer nation in pollination. A paradox had saved us.<br> <br>I stretched as far as I could, but couldn&#x2019;t quite reach the blossom at the very top. I was about to give up, but knew I might be punished, so I tried once more. Our pay was docked if we used up the pollen too quickly. And our pay was docked if we used too little. The work was invisible. When at the end of the day we climbed down from the trees, there was no evidence of our work except for the red chalk X&#x2019;s on the tree trunks, ideally up to forty trees each day. It wasn&#x2019;t until autumn came and the trees were laden with fruit that we would know who among us had actually succeeded in their work. And by then we had usually forgotten which trees had been dusted by whom.<br> <br>I was assigned to Field 748 today. Out of how many? I didn&#x2019;t know. My group was one of hundreds. In our beige work uniforms we were just as anonymous as the trees. And just as close together as the flowers. Never alone, always together in a flock, up here in the trees, or wandering down the tire ruts from one field to the next. Only behind the walls of our own small flats could we be alone, a few short hours a day. Our whole lives were out here.<br> <br>It was quiet. We weren&#x2019;t allowed to speak while we worked. The only sound to be heard was that of our careful movements in the trees, a faint clearing of the throat, some yawns and the material of our uniforms against the tree trunks. And sometimes the sound we had all learned to dislike&#x2014;a branch creaking and in the worst case breaking. A broken branch meant less fruit, and yet another reason to dock our pay.<br> <br>Otherwise only the wind was audible, passing through branches, brushing across the blossoms, slipping through the grass on the ground.<br> <br>A fly buzzed through the air, a rare sight. It had been several days since I had seen a bird, there were fewer of them as well. They hunted the few insects to be found, and starved, like the rest of the world.<br> <br>But then an earsplitting sound broke the silence. It was the whistle from the management&#x2019;s barracks, the signal for the second and final break of the day. I noticed immediately how parched my tongue was.<br> <br>I climbed down with awkward caution. My workmates and I crept down from the trees to the ground. The other women had already begun chatting, as if their cacophonic prattle was flipped on like a switch the split second they knew that they could.<br> <br>I said nothing, concentrating on getting down without breaking a branch. I managed it. Pure luck. I was infinitely clumsy, had been working out here long enough to know that I would never be really good at the job.<br> <br>On the ground beside the tree was a beat-up metal water bottle. I grabbed it and drank quickly. The water was lukewarm and tasted of aluminum, the taste made me drink less than I needed.<br> <br>Two young boys dressed in white from the Trade Commission rapidly distributed the reusable tin boxes containing the second meal of the day. I sat down by myself with my back against the tree trunk and opened mine. The rice was mixed with corn today. I ate quickly. As usual, a bit too salty, and seasoned with artificially manufactured chili pepper and soy. It had been a long time since I had tasted meat. Animal feed required too much arable land. And a lot of the traditional animal feed required pollination. The animals weren&#x2019;t worth our painstaking handiwork.<br> <br>The tin box was empty before I was full. I stood up and put it back in the return basket from the Trade Commission. Then I jogged in place. My legs were tired, but nonetheless stiff from standing still in locked positions up there in the trees. My blood tingled; I couldn&#x2019;t stand still.<br> <br>But it didn&#x2019;t help. I took a quick look around me. Nobody from management was paying attention. I quickly lay down on the ground, just to stretch out my back. It was aching after having been bent over in the same position for a long time.<br> <br>I closed my eyes for a moment, tried to shut out the conversation of the other women of the crew, instead listening to how the chatter rose and fell in volume. This need to talk, all of them at the same time, where did it come from? The other women had started when they were little girls. Hour after hour of group conversations where the subject was always of the lowest common denominator and one could never really go into depth about anything. Perhaps with the exception of when the one being talked about wasn&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>Personally I preferred one-on-one conversations. Or my own company, for that matter. At work, often the latter. At home I had Kuan, my husband. Not that we had the longest conversations, either, conversation wasn&#x2019;t what held us together. Kuan&#x2019;s references were here and now, he was concrete, didn&#x2019;t crave knowledge, something more. But in his arms I found peace. And then we had Wei-Wen, our three-year-old. Him we could talk about.<br> <br>Just as the cacophony had almost sung me to sleep, it suddenly fell silent. Everyone was quiet.<br> <br>I sat up. The others on the crew were facing the road.<br> <br>The entourage was walking down the tire ruts and towards us.<br> <br>They were no more than eight or nine years old. I recognized several of them from Wei-Wen&#x2019;s school. All of them had been given identical work clothes, the same synthetic beige uniforms that we were wearing, and they walked towards us as quickly as their short legs could carry them. Two adult leaders kept them in line. One in front, one behind. Both of them were equipped with powerful voices that corrected the children without cease, but they did not reprimand them, giving instructions with warmth and compassion, because even though the children had not yet fully taken in where they were headed, the adults knew.<br> <br>The children walked hand in hand, in mismatched pairs, the tallest with the shortest, the older children taking care of the younger. An uneven gait, disorganized, but the hands held on tight as if they were glued together. Perhaps they had been given strict instructions not to let go.<br> <br>Their eyes were on us, on the trees. Curious, wrinkling their noses a bit, cocking their heads. As if they were here for the first time, even though all of them had grown up in the district and didn&#x2019;t know of any kind of nature other than the endless rows of fruit trees, against the shadow of the overgrown forest in the south. A short girl looked at me for a long time, with big, slightly close-set eyes. She blinked a few times, then sniffed loudly. She held a skinny boy by the hand. He yawned loudly and unabashedly, didn&#x2019;t lift his free hand to his mouth, wasn&#x2019;t even aware that his face stretched open into a gaping hole. He wasn&#x2019;t yawning as an expression of boredom; he was too young for that. It was the shortage of food that caused his fatigue. A tall, frail girl held a little boy by the hand. He was breathing heavily through a stuffed-up nose, with his mouth open, missing both front teeth. The tall girl pulled him behind her while she turned her face towards the sun, squinted and wrinkled her nose, but kept her head in the same position, as if to get some color, or perhaps glean strength.<br> <br>They arrived every spring, the new children. But were they usually so small? Were they younger this time?<br> <br>No. They were eight. As they always were. Finished with their schooling. Or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, they learned numbers and some characters, but beyond that school was only a kind of regulated storage system. Storage and preparation for life out here. Exercises in sitting quietly for a long time. Sit still. Completely still, that&#x2019;s right. And exercises to develop fine motor skills. They wove carpets from the age of three. Their small fingers were ideally suited for work with complex patterns. Just as they were perfect for the work out here.<br> <br>The children passed us, turned their faces to the front, towards other trees. Then they walked on, towards another field. The boy without teeth stumbled a bit, but the tall girl held his hand tightly, so he didn&#x2019;t fall. The parents were not here, but they took care of one another.<br> <br>The children disappeared down along the tire rut, drowned between the trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are they going?&#x201d; a woman from my crew asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; another replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably towards forty-nine or fifty,&#x201d; a third said. &#x201c;Nobody has started there yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>My stomach twisted into a knot. Where they were going, which field they were headed for, made no difference. It was what they were going to do that&#x2014;<br> <br>The whistle sounded from the barracks. We climbed up again. My heart pounded, even though I wasn&#x2019;t out of breath. For the children had not grown smaller. It was Wei-Wen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In five years he would be eight. In just five years. Then it would be his turn. The hardworking hands were worth more out here than anywhere else. The small fingers, already accustomed to weaving carpets, trained in fine motor skills every single day at school, already fine-tuned for this type of work.<br> <br>Eight-year-olds out here, day in and day out, stiffened small bodies in the trees. Not even an excuse for a childhood, as my peers and I had had. We had gone to school until we were fifteen.<br> <br>A non-life.<br> <br>My hands shook as I lifted the hand holding the precious dust. We all had to work to acquire food, it was said, to make the food we would eat ourselves. Everyone had to contribute, even the children. Because who needs an education when the wheat stores are diminishing? When the rations become smaller and smaller with each passing month? When one must go to bed hungry in the evenings?<br> <br>I turned around to reach the blossoms behind me, but this time my movements were too abrupt. I hit a branch that I had not noticed, suddenly lost my balance and leaned heavily over to the other side.<br> <br>And that did it. The cracking sound we had come to hate. The sound of a branch breaking.<br> <br>The supervisor came quickly towards me. She looked up into the tree and assessed the damage without saying anything. Quickly she wrote something down on a pad of paper before leaving again.<br> <br>The branch was neither large nor strong, but I knew all the same that my entire surplus for this month would vanish. The money that was supposed to go into the tin box in the kitchen cupboard where we saved every single yuan we could spare.<br> <br>I drew a breath. I couldn&#x2019;t think about it. I couldn&#x2019;t do anything but keep going. Lift my hand, dip the brush into the pollen, move it carefully towards the blossoms, brush across them as if I were a bee.<br> <br>I avoided looking at my watch. Knew it wouldn&#x2019;t help. I only knew that with each flower I moved the brush across, the evening came a bit closer. And the one hour I had every day with my child. That tiny hour was all we had, and in that tiny hour perhaps I could make a difference. Sow a seed that would give him the opportunity that I myself never had.</p><h2>Past Tense: A Brady Coyne Novel (Brady Coyne Novels)</h2><p>Brady Coyne is a middle-aged Boston attorney with a small, select clientele - one that leaves him sufficient time to pursue a personal life. That personal life currently focuses on Evie Banyon, a hospital administrator Brady has been seeing for the past year. While they are on a weekend vacation in Cape Cod, though, a determined stalker from Evie's past turns up to torment her anew. After an unpleasant confrontation with him, Brady and Evie return to their vacation cabin with a dark cloud hanging over them. The next morning, Brady wakes up to the sound of Evie, just outside the cabin, screaming for help. What he finds is the stalker's murdered body lying at Evie's feet, a body she claims to have discovered when she returned from her morning run. <br><br>Now both Brady and Evie are considered prime suspects in the murder of a man with deep ties to the local community. Released by the police after intense questioning, they return to Boston, whereupon Evie disappears without word or much of a trace. Realizing just how little he knows about Evie's life, Brady Coyne must now delve into her past if he is to uncover the truth about the dead body in his front yard and find the missing Evie in time. <br></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, November 2001:</b> William Tapply's Brady Coyne novels have long delivered meticulous plots and a strong moral sense, and <i>Past Tense</i>, the series' 18th entry, lives up to that solid standard. (Having for a time been Tapply's publisher, I speak both as a fan and as one familiar with his professionalism.)<p> Coyne, a Boston attorney in private practice with a penchant for good-Samaritan trouble-shooting, is one of those mystery heroes in whom decency is perhaps the paramount characteristic. Liked equally by men and women, Brady usually manages to keep a level head when bad things start to happen, but always in a believable way. He sometimes gets things wrong, but that's okay because he'll usually find a way to sort them out.</p><p> A steady intelligence is always present, and the reader increasingly appreciates the carefulness with which his creator regards the human condition: the relationships between men and women, parents and children, workers and their colleagues, the guilty and the innocent. Betrayal, above all, is something he seems to have made a special area of study.</p><p> <i>Past Tense</i> opens as Brady and his current lady friend, Evie Banyon, are headed off to a Cape Cod rental for a long weekend's getaway. At a local seafood shanty, after a satisfying lobster feast, their idyll suddenly is shattered by an intrusion from Evie's past. Even after she has hauled off and slapped the insolent stranger staring at her from the bar (a man she accuses of having followed her there, much to Brady's confused astonishment), Brady doesn't expect to discover the fellow dead outside their cottage the next morning.</p><p> The question soon becomes not "Who was the late Larry Scott?" but "Who is Evelyn Banyon?" This is a little too close to home as far as Brady is concerned, and it only gets worse when Evie disappears, seeming not to want Brady to find her. The answers to the baffling turn of events lie in Evie's past--and in Brady's desire to remain part of her future. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>An Unexpected Visitor<br>When Boston lawyer Brady Coyne takes his girlfriend Evie up to Cape Cod for a romantic weekend getaway, the last thing he expects to find in the driveway of their secluded cottage is the body of her murdered ex.<br><br>A Bizarre Disappearance<br> But when police declare her a chief suspect in the murder, Evie disappears without a trace, leaving Brady to face skeptical small-town cops. Watched at every turn, he goes looking for his girl, knowing he has to find the real killer if he ever hopes to clear Evie's name and save his own reputation.<br><br>A Dark Secret<br>More corpses surface as Brady races against the clock to find the truth, taking him closer and closer to a deadly secret from the past-and a twisted killer...<br><br>"If you haven't made a pilgrimage [to read Tapply] lately, <i>Past Tense</i> is a fine place to plunge back in. There's a wonderfully sexy woman...named Evie with a past that would make Ross Macdonald drool; a Cape Cod setting so richly evoked you can taste the shepherd's pie in the local diner; and above all, Tapply's always-wise, never-cynical hero." -<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br></p><h2>The population bomb</h2><p>Paul R. Ehrlich's best-selling The Population Bomb predicted disaster due to overpopulation, that "in the 1970s &amp; 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death", that nothing can be done to avoid mass famine &amp; radical action is needed to limit overpopulation. The book is a Malthusian catastrophe argument, that population growth will outpace agricultural growth unless controlled. Ehrlich assumes population is going to rise exponentially &amp; that available resources are at their limits. Whereas Malthus didn't make firm predictions of imminent catastrophe, Ehrlich warned of potential massive disasters. Unlike Malthus, he didn't see any means of avoiding the disaster entirely. The solutions for limiting its scope he proposed were more radical than those Malthus postulated. The book deals not only with food shortage, but also with other crises caused by rapid population growth, expressing the possibility of disaster in broader terms. A population bomb requires: A rapid rate of change A limit of some sort Delays in perceiving the limit The predictions came true, but the effects are mainly unfelt in the developed world. Food production grows exponentially at a rate higher than population growth, in both developed &amp; developing countries, partially due to the efforts of Borlaug's Green Revolution of the '60s. Food per capita is the highest in history. On one hand population growth rates significantly slowed down, especially in the developed world. Famine hasn't been eliminated, but its root cause is political instability, not global food shortage. On the other hand, in the '80s &amp; '90s in a number of countries population growth rates still exceeded economic growth. On quite a few occasions political instability was caused by food shortages.</p><p></p><h2>Coyote: A Trickster Tale from the American Southwest</h2><p>Coyote finds trouble wherever he goes. Now he wants to sing, dance, and fly like the crows, so he begs them to teach him how. The crows, however, decide to teach Coyote a lesson instead. This is the third volume in Gerald McDermott&#x2019;s series of Trickster Tales. &#x201c;Bold shapes and expansive double spreads (as well as an economically pared text) recommend the book for story hours large or small; pair it with McDermott&#x2019;s more mystical Raven for some vibrant cross-cultural contrast.&#x201d;--<i>The Bulletin</i><br></p><p>GERALD MCDERMOTT (1941-2012) was an internationally acclaimed author-illustrator and the creator of numerous award-winning books and animated films for children.

Yet tonight comes a cry that I wasn&#x2019;t expecting, that hauls me out of sleep, a chorus of wailing above a percussion of yips, excited and eerie and twitching my heart. <br> Coyotes. Their very existence makes this place seem risky and wild. I hadn&#x2019;t reckoned on their presence when we made an offer on the place. Carpenter ants and powder-post beetles, flying squirrels and foraging deer, gray squirrels fattened on acorns and birdseed, plenty of roaming bear &#x2014; these were the known parts of the package, along with what we could see for rot in the sills, what we hoped was solid framing behind the new siding, and what we couldn&#x2019;t quite follow in the network of old knob-and-tube wiring. <br> But at the thought of a pack of coyotes &#x2014; a gang, a family &#x2014; another sensation crawls across my skin, like knowing someone is behind a door before a hand can slam it shut. <br> I want to see them. <br> I want to find their outlines when I scan the edges of the meadow. I want to know if I&#x2019;m being watched while I work in the garden or mow the field. I want to know where they sleep and spend their days, where they go when the neighboring dogs race through or when November arrives after the leaves have blown free and hunters slip into the newly naked woods. <br> Mostly I want to know how they&#x2019;re managing here in Massachusetts, in this place I&#x2019;ve returned to twenty-.ve years after leaving. Coyotes were just sliding into the landscape back then, rarely seen and seldom heard, and only starting to appear in northern Vermont, where I first lived as a young adult. I saw them sometimes from a distance. I heard them now and again at night, that same rupture of my sleep, something separate from the weave of other sounds. And once I met a coyote in a field, each of us too distracted by the hot August buzzing to notice the other until we were both in full view. Without taking its eyes from me, it did a slow turn, lowered itself into the grass, and disappeared. I backed up to the field&#x2019;s edge, to the shadow of a big rock maple, and waited for an hour. It didn&#x2019;t return; its shape never reformed inside that dense weave of grass. <br> I want to know how they disappear like that. <br> <br>Those of us who decide to return home run certain risks. We lose the luster of the one who got away, the status that accrued when no one really knew what we did with our time. We no longer feel free to move on whenever plans change, a relationship doesn&#x2019;t work out, another job beckons from somewhere farther afield. We become accessible and known and have to face tomorrow the mistakes we make today. <br> For me, being home again means having to bridge the gaps between the kid I was when I left and the adult I&#x2019;ve become. That seems most obvious when my tender-hearted father calls and leaves a message on the machine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your daddy,&#x201d; he says, his voice as it was when I was five and six and seven, not that of a man in his seventies addressing his forty- something daughter. Later, when our paths cross in town, the joy on his face feels equal to my own at the unexpected chance to catch up on more of what we missed during all those years we spent so far apart. <br> It&#x2019;s the same with my five siblings when we jostle and tease each other as we did when we were teens; then we step back and wonder when the gray crept in and the wrinkles inched across our faces. All of them have kids now, ranging in age from one to eighteen, children amiable and curious, though I can&#x2019;t tell yet if any have a name for the aunt who came back with her companion, a woman with a past that is full and unknown to them. It&#x2019;s partly Yankee reticence, this reluctance to talk about the less visible part of our lives; it&#x2019;s partly a wish not to be misunderstood. But it might also indicate how much has changed since that day I left in order to become my whole self. <br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never be able to move back home,&#x201d; a former partner once told me, and I believed her. She was older, and I thought she was wiser; she studied family relationships as part of her job. Years passed before I understood that by saying I&#x2019;d be smothered by the traditions that abound here, she meant she was afraid of what they might do to her. <br> For me, fear that I couldn&#x2019;t be myself was a natural consequence of years bounded by tradition, centuries of Puritan-tight belts and stiff upper lips defining our options like lines of barbed wire inscribing old woods. As a teenager, however, I was oblivious to history&#x2019;s impact. Everything was new and possible, and I&#x2019;d felt free to come and go as I wanted, to slip back annd forth between adulthood and adolescence. Yet I was caught unawares by the arrival of a love I knew to be unlike any other I had experiiiiienced. I was even more startled by the reactions from those who had always encouraged me. They had never said No, they had never said Don&#x2019;t, so when they pulled back in anguish &#x2014; You can&#x2019;t love her! &#x2014; I was unmoored. The rope connecting me with the familiar had been cut, and a part of me folded up, a part that has often felt stranded in despair. <br> <br>The property we found is in the hills of Franklin County, with the summits of the Berkshires a few miles to the west and the taller mountains of Vermont just to the north. To the east a short downward slope separates us from the flat expanse of the Connecticut River valley. As a child growing up near the river, I was sure that the hill people had far sturdier and more inventive lives than those of us stuck on flatter land. But after high school I never spent much time here, except for the year I hiked north with spring, from Georgia to Maine along the Appalachian Trail. By the time I reached New England, I had been out for about three months and loved being back within reach of familiar- sounding towns &#x2014; Stockbridge, Dalton, Pittsfield, North Adams &#x2014; enjoying the resonance of known accents and idioms, the way words like &#x201c;the Berkshires&#x201d; felt in my mouth. But I never thought I would live here, that the pull of home would be so strong, hauling me back from a thousand miles away. <br> A selling point of the property was that it had not one but three structures: an old farmhouse, a barn, and a much smaller building, about seventy-five feet across the lawn. We designated it the studio, and I won the coin toss for its use. A previous owner had run a small-engine repair shop out of it; another had sold used books. The latter must have been the one who had it wired and insulated, had a phone line brought in, had the walls covered with Sheetrock and painted. No one ever dealt with the concrete floor, however, which sloped toward a drain at its center. <br> Another benefit of moving back was that my siblings had most of the necessary skills for building or repairing whatever we wanted to fix. My youngest brother, Doug, spent much of his vacation time showing me how to erect jacks in the cellar under overly long joists and how to refinish the banged-up wood floors. We also spent hours in the studio leveling sleepers across the concrete floor and securing them with a gunpowder-driven hammer, each slam like a pistol going off in the small building. We fitted tongue-and-groove birch plywood on top, and immediately the room felt warmer and tighter. When his vacation ended and we were on our own, I continued to borrow Doug&#x2019;s tools and seek advice over the phone. <br> My brother Arthur helped as well, mostly by explaining how things worked. He reassured me about the knob-and-tube wiring, the gas heater in the studio, the buckling wall at the bottom of the barn. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s probably an old well cover,&#x201d; he said of the large, .at fieldstone in the barn floor. He offered to help lift it when I was finally curious enough. Then my oldest brother, Bob, brought two of his sons and a high-sided truck to the place we rented while readying the property, and their energy and hustle (sparked by the promise of a swim in the river) made the move to Shelburne Falls seem easy. <br> I like knowing that they are all close and would help in any way they could. But I need to sort out the rest of this on my own; it&#x2019;s how I learn. It&#x2019;s how I figure out what it will take to support my life. With the paint dry and the boxes emptied, I don&#x2019;t need to be inside the house any longer. It&#x2019;s time to learn the lay of this land. <br> I wander through the field to the narrow trail I found when first walking the property lines, which are defined mostly by old stone walls and a seasonal, moss-lined trickle. Two neighboring dogs use the path most often, but one morning last week I saw a young buck on it about to step into the field. We stopped at the same time to watch each other, but I relented first and slipped into the studio. From a shadow by the window I kept track of the deer&#x2019;s indecision &#x2014; forward, back, forward, back &#x2014; until a door slammed behind me and it disappeared in a flash of white tail. <br> Today I follow the path over a hill of white pine. To the north is a gentle slope of mountain laurel and princess pine, partridge berry and rattlesnake plantain; a steady brook churns in the small valley below. The railroad tracks run along the woods to the east; beyond them lies the Deerfield River, the Massamet Ridge rising steeply just beyond it. <br> Most of this I recognize and take comfort in, despite the years I&#x2019;ve been away. I like to think that my return here is fresh enough that familiarity won&#x2019;t lead me to have blind spots, that my powers of observation won&#x2019;t relax among smells and rhythms that soothe like nursery rhymes. Keeping watch for something as elusive as a coyote should keep me alert to nuance and able to locate signs different from the ones I once expected. <br> It&#x2019;s tricky &#x2014; I know this; do I know this? &#x2014; like trying to walk toe- heel down the trail, something I practiced for weeks as a kid when I wanted to walk as silently as the Indians I had read about. I can do it now if I concentrate, but my heel hits first when I look anywhere but at the trail ahead of me, which I keep doing until I&#x2019;m almost home. It&#x2019;s when the house and the barn are within sight that I find the first sign in my search &#x2014; coyote scat in the clearing under a large white pine. <br> It&#x2019;s easy to distinguish from that of a dog, which looks like reprocessed Alpo, or that of a fox, which is narrower and has less heft. This mass is stringy and long and full of apple seeds and cherry pits, tiny bones and maple seeds, and a piece of waxed paper, wrinkled and wedged between clumps of matted hair. <br> <br>The house Holly and I occupy was built in 1894, the year the last passenger pigeon was shot in Massachusetts and about fifty years after the state&#x2019;s last wolf was killed. I don&#x2019;t know when the barn that used to stand on this foundation was built, but in the years between the gray wolf&#x2019;s death and the raising of this house, a series of animals was driven out of the state: the last wild turkey, shot in 1851 and only recently reintroduced; the last mountain lion, killed in 1858; the last lynx, in 1860; the last marten, in 1880. <br> I think about little of this history when I check mouse traps in the cellar. Holes riddle the foundation, small, dingy tunnels that stretch out of sight, some of them large enough to accommodate weasels. It seems terribly fragile, stone on stone, a little mortar or whitewash in between, and above it a two-story house delicately placed on notched and pitted sills. <br> Two of the traps contain bodies, and I walk outside to toss them into the thicket behind the barn. Then, curious, I force a path through the brush to see where the carcasses landed. Stiff blackberry thorns catch at my sweater, and I have to stop several times to unpin them. But when I reach the tall elderberry, I don&#x2019;t find any of the mice I&#x2019;ve flung these last two months &#x2014; two or three dozen total. Instead, I find one bedraggled, inedible mole and the telltale scat of coyotes. <br> They&#x2019;ve been scarfing up small mouse bodies at night. <br> They&#x2019;ve been within twenty-five feet of the house, maybe even closer, and I haven&#x2019;t seen or heard them. I&#x2019;ve simply been the unwitting purveyor, rewarding their approach. <br> I feel the same mix of awe and caution that I did when I fed a fox from my hand during one of the springs I lived on Deer Isle, off the coast of Maine. A mother fox, her fur matted, her teats swollen, had barked me out of the house in her hunger. Curious as to what she would do, I set half my sandwich on a rock and walked away. She took it and ran. For the next several weeks I tossed her more chunks of sandwich or muffin whenever she appeared in the clearing. Then I bought her Milk-Bones, which she liked, and both of us began taking more time with the exchange (I didn&#x2019;t let myself think for long about the cost to her of such an association, about whether the next person she approached would hold food or a gun; I simply used her ragged belly as an excuse for the transactions). At last, instead of dropping the food in front of her, I kept it in my hand, and she scarcely hesitated before lifting it from my palm with her teeth. <br> My body didn&#x2019;t know whether to scream or laugh when she darted away. I could see only how she took it &#x2014; sharp, white fox teeth, a breath away from my skin. <br> <br>Copyright � 2004 by Catherine Reid.

Truly gripping&#39; Andrew Roberts The Battle of the Atlantic was the single most important - and longest - campaign of the Second World War. If Britain lost this vital supply route it lost the war. In Jonathan Dimbleby&#39;s brilliant and dramatic new account we see how this epic struggle for maritime mastery played out, from the politicians and admirals to the men on and under the sea and their families waiting at home.

He was highly sceptical of the many claims made concerning psychic and paranormal phenomena, which were very popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He attended hundreds of s�ances for the purposes of his study, and never experienced one he believed genuine. In this book, published in 1924, he described the mediums and psychics whom he revealed as fraudulent, exposing the tricks which had convinced many notable scientists and academics. These included spirit writing, table rapping, spirit manifestations, and levitation. Among those he revealed as frauds was the famous medium Mina Crandon, and his exposures led to a public split with his former friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a firm believer.

Symbolizing the world, identifying landmasses and waterways, and defining our borders, maps help to create the context in which we live and the history that we study. At times, in projecting information, maps initiate or perpetuate errors. At times, explorers and cartographers have depicted fancies rather than facts, and wishes rather than wisdom. Maps have misinformed! The Mismapping of America presents and analyzes the significant cartographic errors that have shaped the history of the United States. Perhaps the most blatant error is the very name &#34;America,&#34; that honors Amerigo Vespucci, who not only never set foot on North American soil, but also played no significant role in the discovery of South America. The appearance of the name &#34;America&#34; imprinted on a map ensured its permanence. Other significant errors explored in The Mismapping of America include: Giovanni da Verrazzano&#39;s misinterpretation of Pamlico or Albermarle Sound for the Pacific Ocean, thereby suggesting the presence of an isthmus in the middle of the North American continent, the existence of a direct North West passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the misconception that California was an island, and the insertion on Lake Superior of a fictitious island that is specifically referred to in defining the boundary of the United States. The inclusion of pertinent rare maps enhances this rich and revealing narrative of several intriguing episodes in the history of the geographic evolution of the United States. Seymour I.

Gray, INTL JOURNAL OF MARITIME HISTORY</p><h2>Collected Poems 1948-1984</h2><p>This remarkable collection, which won the 1986 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Poetry, includes most of the poems from each of Derek Walcott&#39;s seven prior books of verse and all of his long autobiographical poem, &#34;Another Life.&#34; The 1992 Nobel Laureate in Literature, Walcott has been producing--for several decades--a poetry with all the beauty, wisdom, directness, and narrative force of our classic myths and fairy tales, and in this hefty volume readers will find a full record of his important endeavor. &#34;Walcott&#39;s virutes as a poet are extraordinary,&#34; James Dickey wrote in The New York Times Book Review. &#34;He could turn his attention on anything at all and make it live with a reality beyond its own; through his fearless language it becomes not only its acquired life, but the real one, the one that lasts . . . Walcott is spontaneous, headlong, and inventive beyond the limits of most other poets now writing.&#34;</p><p>Derek Walcott was born in St. Lucia in 1930. He is the author of thirteen collections of poetry, seven collections of plays, and a book of essays. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992."One of the most instructive experiences afforded by this collected edition is the spectacle of a poet moving with gradually deepening confidence to found his own poetic domain, independent of the tradition he inherited yet not altogether orphaned from it . . . This is a triumphant book."--Seamus Heaney, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"It is difficult to think of a poet in our century who--without ever betraying his native sources--has so organically assimilated the evolution of English literature from the Renaissance to the present, who has absorbed the Classical and Judeo-Christian past, and who has mined the history of Western painting as Walcott has. Throughout his entire body of work he has managed to hold in balance his passionate moral concerns with the ideal of art. By his fifty-fifth year Derek Walcott has made his culture, history, and sociology into a myth for our age and into an epic song that has already taken its place in the history of Western literature."--Peter Balakian, <i>Poetry</i><br></p><h2>The Big Store</h2><p>Recounts how the Sears, Roebuck, and Company came back from the brink of ruin and transformed itself into the corporation of the future</p><p>Katz writes about the recent changes at Sears, Roebuck, the country's largest retailer. The chief protagonist is Edward Telling, chairman from 1977 through 1984. Faced with falling net income, under Telling Sears diversified beyond retail merchandising into retail financial and real estate services. The merchandise division shrank, and underwent an internal shakeup. Katz, who was given unlimited research access by Sears, devotes most of the book to the men who worked and fought at Sears headquarters in Chicago, but enlivens his reporting with notes from the checkout counter where he once worked.

A button is missing from his w aistcoat, pulled too tight for the threads to bear. Maman wrings her&nbsp; hands&#x2014;laundress&#x2019;s hands, marked by chapped skin, raw knuckles. &#x201c;But, Monsieur LeBlanc,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;we just put my dead husband in the ground.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been two weeks, Madame van Goethem. You said you needed two weeks.&#x201d; No sooner had Papa taken his last breath upon this earth than, same as now, Monsieur LeBlanc stood in the doorway of our lodging room demanding the three months&#x2019; rent Papa had fallen behind in paying since getting sick.<br><br> Maman drops to her knees, grasps the hem of Monsieur Le Blanc&#x2019;s greatcoat. &#x201c;You cannot turn us out. My daughters, all three good girls, you would put them on the street?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Take pity,&#x201d; I say, joining Maman at his feet.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, pity,&#x201d; says Charlotte, my younger sister, and I wince. She plays her part too well for a child not yet eight.<br><br> Only Antoinette, the oldest of the three of us, remains silent, defiant, chin held high. But then she is never afraid.<br><br>Charlotte grasps one of Monsieur LeBlanc&#x2019;s hands in both her own, kisses it, rests her cheek against its back. he sighs heavily, and it seems tiny&nbsp; Charlotte&#x2014;adored by the pork butcher, the watchmaker, the crockery&nbsp; dealer&#x2014;has saved us from the street.<br><br> Seeing his face shift to soft, Maman says, &#x201c;Take my ring,&#x201d; and slips her wedding band from her finger. She presses it to her lips before placing it in Monsieur LeBlanc&#x2019;s waiting hand. Then with great drama her palms fly to the spot on her chest just over her heart. Not wanting him to see in my eyes what I know about Maman&#x2019;s feelings for Papa, I turn my face away. Whenever Papa mentioned he was a tailor, apprenticed to a master as a boy, Maman always said, &#x201c;The only tailoring you ever done is stitching the overalls the men at the porcelain factory wear.&#x201d;<br><br> Monsieur LeBlanc closes his fingers around the ring. &#x201c;Two weeks more,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll pay up then.&#x201d; Or a cart will haul off the sideboard handed down to Papa before he died, the table and three rickety chairs the lodger before us left behind, the mattresses stuffed with wool, each handful worth five sous to a pawnbroker. Our lodging room will be empty, only four walls, grimy and soot laden, deprived of a lick of whitewash. And there will be a new lock on the door and the concierge, old Madame Legat, fingering the key in her pocket, her gaze sorrowful on the curve of Charlotte&#x2019;s pretty cheek. Of the three of us, only Antoinette is old enough to remember nights in a dingy stairwell, days on the boulevard haussmann, palms held out, empty, the rustle of the silk skirts passing by. She told me once how it was that other time, when Papa sold his s ewing machine to pay for a tiny white gown with crocheted lace, a small white coffin with a painting of two cherubs blowing horns, a priest to say the Mass.<br><br>I am the namesake of a small dead child, Marie, or Marie the&nbsp;First as I usually think of her. Before her second birthday, she was rigid in her cradle, eyes fixed on what she could not see, and then I&nbsp; came&#x2014;a gift, Maman said&#x2014;to take her place.<br><br>...<br><br>&#x201c;God bless,&#x201d; Charlotte calls out to Monsieur LeBlanc&#x2019;s retreating back.<br><br> Maman pushes herself up like an old woman, staggering under the heft of widowhood, daughters, monies owed, an empty larder. She reaches into her apron pocket, tilts a small bottle of green liquid to her lips, wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.<br><br> &#x201c;We owe for the week&#x2019;s milk, and there&#x2019;s enough for that?&#x201d; Antoinette says, chin jutting.<br><br> &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen a sou from you in a month. Still a walker-�on at the Op�ra, at seventeen years old. You got no idea about work.&#x201d; Antoinette pulls her lips tight, looks down her nose at Maman, who does not let up. &#x201c;A measly two francs they pay you for loitering on the stage,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;and only if whatever costume the wardrobe mistress pressed happens to fit. Too high and mighty for the washhouse. Nothing good will come of you. I can see that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Like mother, like daughter, no?&#x201d; Antoinette says, holding a pretend bottle to her lips.<br><br> Maman lifts the absinthe the smallest bit more but only twists the cork back into place. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll take your sisters to the dance school at the Op�ra in the morning,&#x201d; Maman says to Antoinette; and light comes into Charlotte&#x2019;s face. Three&nbsp;times a week she says how the Paris Op�ra is the greatest opera house in all the world.<br><br> Sometimes Antoinette shows Charlotte and me the steps she learned at the Op�ra dance school, back in the days before she was&nbsp;told not to come back, and we stand with our heels together, our feet turned out, bending our knees.<br><br> &#x201c;Knees over your toes,&#x201d; Antoinette would say. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. A pli�.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What else?&#x201d; usually Charlotte asked, but sometimes it was me. The evenings were long and dull, and in the wintertime a few pli�s in a bit of candlelight took away the shivering before curling up on our mattress for the night.<br><br> Antoinette taught us battements tendus, ronds de jambe, grands battements, on and on. She would stoop to adjust the ankle of Charlotte&#x2019;s outstretched foot. &#x201c;Such feet,&#x201d; she would say. &#x201c;Feet of a dancer, pet.&#x201d;<br><br> Almost always it was Charlotte she bothered to correct. Maman liked to say how it was time I earned my keep, how even the girls in the Op�ra dance school were handed seventy francs each month, but already Papa had slapped his hand down on the table. &#x201c;enough,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Marie is to stay put, in Sister evangeline&#x2019;s classroom, where she belongs.&#x201d; Later, alone, he whispered into my ear that I was clever, my mind meant for studying, that Sister evangeline had bothered to wait for him outside the porcelain factory and tell him it was so. Still I joined in, and even if Antoinette said my back was supple and my hips were loose, even if I sometimes found myself dancing my own made�up dance when the music of the fiddler down below came up through the planks of the floor, we both knew Papa&#x2019;s word would hold. her eyes were on tiny Charlotte, extending a leg behind&nbsp;her in an arabesque and then lifting it high above the floor, all the while Antoinette making adjustments and calling out, &#x201c;Arms soft. Knee straight. Neck long. That&#x2019;s it. You got a neck like Taglioni, pet.&#x201d;<br><br> On Antoinette&#x2019;s name day when she was eight, Papa brought out from inside the sleeve of his coat a figurine of Marie Taglioni, hovering barefoot, wings spread, only the toes of one foot upon&nbsp;the earth. Nearly fifty years ago she claimed a place for herself in the heart of every Parisian by dancing <i>La Sylphide</i>, and still her legend lived on. Antoinette kissed the tiny face of the figurine a dozen times and put it high up on the mantelshelf to be adored. Anyone looking there would have seen it, a tiny sylph, beside Maman&#x2019;s old clock. But then Antoinette failed the examination that would have promoted her from the second set of the quadrille to the first and was dismissed from the Paris Op�ra Ballet for arguing with Monsieur Pluque, the director of dance. &#x201c;That mouth of yours,&#x201d; Maman said.<br><br>&#x201c;I only said to him I could make more fouett�s en tournant than Martine, that my footwork was superior to that of Carole.&#x201d; I could picture Antoinette standing there, arms crossed, insolence on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ugly and skinny, that&#x2019;s what he says back to me.&#x201d;<br><br> The figurine was gone from the mantelshelf the next day, maybe to the pawnbroker, maybe smashed upon the cobblestones.</p><h2>The Practice of the Presence of God</h2><p><p><em>BROTHER LAWRENCE of the Resurrection&nbsp;&nbsp; (c. 1614 12 February 1691) served as a lay brother in a Carmelite monastery in Paris.

In <em>Outrageous Fortune</em>, London-based journalist Tom Bower reveals how Conrad and Lady Black used other people's money to finance a billionaire's lifestyle, winning friends and influence in London and New York along the way. Their story of overweening ambition and greed is a modern-day classic of hubris.</p><p>Born into considerable wealth in Canada, Conrad Black bought and sold (but never effectively managed) several businesses, from mining and tractors to broadcasting companies and newspapers. In 1985 Black's holding com-pany, Hollinger, bought the Telegraph Group, the British newspaper publishing conglomerate. In the years that followed, Black additionally became the proprietor of the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, and a host of other magazines and newspapers in the English-speaking world.</p><p>In 1992 Conrad married Barbara Amiel, who later famously said, "I have an extravagance that knows no bounds." Besotted by his wife, he began living way beyond his means. Fabulous parties, jewelry, clothes, and multiple mansions followed, and by 2001 Black had renounced his Canadian citizenship&#x2014;which he called "an impediment to my progress in another more amenable jurisdiction"&#x2014;in order to become a life peer in the British House of Lords.</p><p>But the scheming deceptive duo's lies came crashing down when, in November 2003, an American report accused Black of "outright fraud," "ethical corruption," and "corporate kleptocracy." Black was forced out as Hollinger's chief executive, and two years later he was charged with eight counts of fraud&#x2014;allegations that he will vigorously deny at his trial in Chicago, beginning in March of 2007.</p><p>Based on hundreds of interviews with bankers, politicians, journalists, mega-deal makers, and close friends of Conrad and Lady Black, <em>Outrageous Fortune</em> is packed with lively anecdotes and salacious gossip.

For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.</p> <p>With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. <i>Born to Run</i> is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.</p> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Christopher McDougall</strong> <br> <p> <b>Question:</b> <i>Born to Run</i> explores the life and running habits of the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico&#x2019;s Copper Canyon, arguably the greatest distance runners in the world. What are some of the secrets you learned from them?</p> <p><b>Christopher McDougall:</b> The key secret hit me like a thunderbolt. It was so simple, yet such a jolt. It was this: everything I&#x2019;d been taught about running was wrong. We treat running in the modern world the same way we treat childbirth&#x2014;it&#x2019;s going to hurt, and requires special exercises and equipment, and the best you can hope for is to get it over with quickly with minimal damage.</p> <p>Then I meet the Tarahumara, and they&#x2019;re having a blast. They remember what it&#x2019;s like to love running, and it lets them blaze through the canyons like dolphins rocketing through waves. For them, running isn&#x2019;t work. It isn&#x2019;t a punishment for eating. It&#x2019;s fine art, like it was for our ancestors. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors finally did make their first cave paintings, what were the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts through the bottom and middle&#x2014;behold, the Running Man.</p> <p>The Tarahumara have a saying: &#x201c;Children run before they can walk.&#x201d; Watch any four-year-old&#x2014;they do everything at full speed, and it&#x2019;s all about fun. That&#x2019;s the most important thing I picked up from my time in the Copper Canyons, the understanding that running can be fast and fun and spontaneous, and when it is, you feel like you can go forever. But all of that begins with your feet. Strange as it sounds, the Tarahumara taught me to change my relationship with the ground. Instead of hammering down on my heels, the way I&#x2019;d been taught all my life, I learned to run lightly and gently on the balls of my feet. The day I mastered it was the last day I was ever injured. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> You trained for your first ultramarathon&#x2014;a race organized by the mysterious gringo expat Caballo Blanco between the Tarahumara and some of America&#x2019;s top ultrarunners&#x2014;while researching and writing this book. What was your training like?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> It really started as kind of a dare. Just by chance, I&#x2019;d met an adventure-sports coach from Jackson Hole, Wyoming named Eric Orton. Eric&#x2019;s specialty is tearing endurance sports down to their basic components and looking for transferable skills. He studies rock climbing to find shoulder techniques for kayakers, and applies Nordic skiing&#x2019;s smooth propulsion to mountain biking. What he&#x2019;s looking for are basic engineering principles, because he&#x2019;s convinced that the next big leap forward in fitness won&#x2019;t come from strength or technology, but plain, simple durability. With some 70% of all runners getting hurt every year, the athlete who can stay healthy and avoid injury will leave the competition behind.</p> <p>So naturally, Eric idolized the Tarahumara. Any tribe that has 90-year-old men running across mountaintops obviously has a few training tips up its sleeve. But since Eric had never actually met the Tarahumara, he had to deduce their methods by pure reasoning. His starting point was uncertainty; he assumed that the Tarahumara step into the unknown every time they leave their caves, because they never know how fast they&#x2019;ll have to sprint after a rabbit or how tricky the climbing will be if they&#x2019;re caught in a storm. They never even know how long a race will be until they step up to the starting line&#x2014;the distance is only determined in a last-minute bout of negotiating and could stretch anywhere from 50 miles to 200-plus.</p> <p>Eric figured shock and awe was the best way for me to build durability and mimic Tarahumara-style running. He&#x2019;d throw something new at me every day&#x2014;hopping drills, lunges, mile intervals&#x2014;and lots and lots of hills. There was no such thing, really, as long, slow distance&#x2014;he&#x2019;d have me mix lots of hill repeats and short bursts of speed into every mega-long run.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t think I could do it without breaking down, and I told Eric that from the start. I basically defied him to turn me into a runner. And by the end of nine months, I was cranking out four hour runs without a problem.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You&#x2019;re a six-foot four-inches tall, 200-plus pound guy&#x2014;not anyone&#x2019;s typical vision of a distance runner, yet you&#x2019;ve completed ultra marathons and are training for more. Is there a body type for running, as many of us assume, or are all humans built to run?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> Yeah, I&#x2019;m a big&#x2019;un. But isn&#x2019;t it sad that&#x2019;s even a reasonable question? I bought into that bull for a loooong time. Why wouldn&#x2019;t I? I was constantly being told by people who should know better that &#x201c;some bodies aren&#x2019;t designed for running.&#x201d; One of the best sports medicine physicians in the country told me exactly that&#x2014;that the reason I was constantly getting hurt is because I was too big to handle the impact shock from my feet hitting the ground. Just recently, I interviewed a nationally-known sports podiatrist who said, &#x201c;You know, we didn&#x2019;t ALL evolve to run away from saber-toothed tigers.&#x201d; Meaning, what? That anyone who isn&#x2019;t sleek as a Kenyan marathoner should be extinct? It&#x2019;s such illogical blather&#x2014;all kinds of body types exist today, so obviously they DID evolve to move quickly on their feet. It&#x2019;s really awful that so many doctors are reinforcing this learned helplessness, this idea that you have to be some kind of elite being to handle such a basic, universal movement. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> If humans are born to run, as you argue, what&#x2019;s your advice for a runner who is looking to make the leap from shorter road races to marathons, or marathons to ultramarathons? Is running really for everyone?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> I think ultrarunning is America&#x2019;s hope for the future. Honestly. The ultrarunners have got a hold of some powerful wisdom. You can see it at the starting line of any ultra race. I showed up at the Leadville Trail 100 expecting to see a bunch of hollow-eyed Skeletors, and instead it was, &#x201c;Whoah! Get a load of the hotties!&#x201d; Ultra runners tend to be amazingly healthy, youthful and&#x2014;believe it or not&#x2014;good looking. I couldn&#x2019;t figure out why, until one runner explained that throughout history, the four basic ingredients for optimal health have been clean air, good food, fresh water and low stress. And that, to a T, describes the daily life of an ultrarunner. They&#x2019;re out in the woods for hours at a time, breathing pine-scented breezes, eating small bursts of digestible food, downing water by the gallons, and feeling their stress melt away with the miles. But here&#x2019;s the real key to that kingdom: you have to relax and enjoy the run. No one cares how fast you run 50 miles, so ultrarunners don&#x2019;t really stress about times. They&#x2019;re out to enjoy the run and finish strong, not shave a few inconsequential seconds off a personal best. And that&#x2019;s the best way to transition up to big mileage races: as coach Eric told me, &#x201c;If it feels like work, you&#x2019;re working too hard.&#x201d; </p> <p><b>Q:</b> You write that distance running is the great equalizer of age and gender. Can you explain?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> Okay, I&#x2019;ll answer that question with a question: Starting at age nineteen, runners get faster every year until they hit their peak at twenty-seven. After twenty-seven, they start to decline. So if it takes you eight years to reach your peak, how many years does it take for you to regress back to the same speed you were running at nineteen?</p> <p>Go ahead, guess all you want. No one I&#x2019;ve asked has ever come close. It&#x2019;s in the book, so I won&#x2019;t give it away, but I guarantee when you hear the answer, you&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;No way. THAT old?&#x201d; Now, factor in this: ultra races are the only sport in the world in which women can go toe-to-toe with men and hand them their heads. Ann Trason and Krissy Moehl often beat every man in the field in some ultraraces, while Emily Baer recently finished in the Top 10 at the Hardrock 100 while stopping to breastfeed her baby at the water stations.</p> <p>So how&#x2019;s that possible? According to a new body of research, it&#x2019;s because humans are the greatest distance runners on earth. We may not be fast, but we&#x2019;re born with such remarkable natural endurance that humans are fully capable of outrunning horses, cheetahs and antelopes. That&#x2019;s because we once hunted in packs and on foot; all of us, men and women alike, young and old together. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> One of the fascinating parts of <i>Born to Run</i> is your report on how the ultrarunners eat&#x2014;salad for breakfast, wraps with hummus mid-run, or pizza and beer the night before a run. As a runner with a lot of miles behind him, what are your thoughts on nutrition for running?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> Live every day like you&#x2019;re on the lam. If you&#x2019;ve got to be ready to pick up and haul butt at a moment&#x2019;s notice, you&#x2019;re not going to be loading up on gut-busting meals. I thought I&#x2019;d have to go on some kind of prison-camp diet to get ready for an ultra, but the best advice I got came from coach Eric, who told me to just worry about the running and the eating would take care of itself. And he was right, sort of. I instinctively began eating smaller, more digestible meals as my miles increased, but then I went behind his back and consulted with the great Dr. Ruth Heidrich, an Ironman triathlete who lives on a vegan diet. She&#x2019;s the one who gave me the idea of having salad for breakfast, and it&#x2019;s a fantastic tip. The truth is, many of the greatest endurance athletes of all time lived on fruits and vegetables. You can get away with garbage for a while, but you pay for it in the long haul. In the book, I describe how Jenn Shelton and Billy &#x201c;Bonehead&#x201d; Barnett like to chow pizza and Mountain Dew in the middle of 100-mile races, but Jenn is also a vegetarian who most days lives on veggie burgers and grapes. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> In this difficult financial time, we&#x2019;re experiencing yet another surge in the popularity of running. Can you explain this?</p> <p><b>CM:</b> When things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket and it&#x2019;s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression; the next was in the &#x2018;70s, when we were struggling to recover from a recession, race riots, assassinations, a criminal President and an awful war. And the third boom? One year after the Sept. 11 attacks, trailrunning suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. I think there&#x2019;s a trigger in the human psyche that activates our first and greatest survival skill whenever we see the shadow of approaching raptors.</p> <p> (Photo � James Rexroad) </p><b>Christopher McDougall</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Super Athletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</i>.

He has a gift for creating engaging, fully realized characters, totally believable dialogue, and a feeling that magic is just around the corner.<p> <i>Someplace to Be Flying</i> is set in Newford, a town familiar to readers of de Lint. (He set two prior novels (<i>Memory and Dream</i> and <i>Trader</i>) and two anthologies (<i>Dreams Underfoot</i> and <i>The Ivory and the Horn</i>) in Newford.) One late night, as Hank drives his gypsy cab, his reliable though perilous city is transformed. He encounters the mythical "animal people," and the experience leaves him--and the reader--questioning accepted reality.</p><p> "Hank just wanted away from here. He'd sampled some hallucinogens when he was a kid and the feeling he had now was a lot like coming down from an acid high. Everything slightly askew, illogical things that somehow made sense, everything too sharp and clear when you looked at it but fading fast in your peripheral vision, blurred, like it didn't really exist." Fans of Emma Bull and Terri Windling (as both an editor and an author) will enjoy de Lint. He can make you believe "as many as six impossible things before breakfast." <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>"As engaging a stylist as Stephen King, but considerably more inventive and ambitious." --<i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i><p> "An enthralling blend of old European and Native American mythology, seamlessly worked into a modern setting and situation. De Lint's best so far." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p> "The reader does not have to be strictly a fan of either thrillers or fantasy to thoroughly enjoy this delightful tale." --<i>The Washington Post</i></p></p><h2>Dogs and How to Breed Them</h2><p>A book written in great detail on all main aspects of breeding, mating, whelping and puppy rearing.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Cat Care Manual: The Ultimate Illustrated Guide to Caring for Your Cat</h2><p>A respected veterinarian covers every aspect of tending to a feline--from daily essentials to crisis management--with step-by-step, specially commissioned photographs, and authoritative text.</p><p>Andrew Edney, B.V.M., M.R.C.V.S., is a noted veterinarian.

Few, that is, except Stephen Jay Gould who, in his new book Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin, proves that all of these intuitive truths are, in fact, wrong. <br><br>"All of these mistaken beliefs arise out of the same analytical flaw in our reasoning, our Platonic tendency to reduce a broad spectrum to a single, pinpointed essence," says Gould. "This way of thinking allows us to confirm our most ingrained biases that humans are the supreme being on this planet; that all things are inherently driven to become more complex; and that almost any subject can be expressed and understood in terms of an average." <br><br>In Full House, Gould shows why a more accurate way of understanding our world (and the history of life) is to look at a given subject within its own context, to see it as a part of a spectrum of variation rather than as an isolated "thing" and then to reconceptualize trends as expansion or contraction of this "full house" of variation, and not as the progress or degeneration of an average value, or single thing. When approached in such a way, the disappearance of .400 hitting becomes a cause for celebration, signaling not a decline in greatness but instead an improvement in the overall level of play in baseball; trends become subject to suspicion, and too often, only a tool of those seeking to advance a particular agenda; and the "Age of Man" (a claim rooted in hubris, not in fact) more accurately becomes the "Age of Bacteria."<br><br>"The traditional mode of thinking has led us to draw many conclusions that don't make satisfying sense," says Gould. "It tells us that .400 hitting has disappeared because batters have gotten worse, but how can that be true when record performances have improved in almost any athletic activity?" In a personal eureka!, Gould realized that we were looking at the picture backward, and that a simple conceptual inversion would resolve a number of the paradoxes of the conventional view.<br><br>While Full House deftly reveals the shortcomings of the popular reasoning we apply to everyday life situations, Gould also explores his beloved realm of natural history as well. Whether debunking the myth of the successful evolution of the horse (he grants that the story still deserves distinction, but as the icon of evolutionary failure); presenting evidence that the vaunted "progress of life" is really random motion away from simple beginnings, not directed impetus toward complexity; or relegating the kingdoms of Animalai and Plantae to their proper positions on the genealogical chart for all of life (as mere twigs on one of the three bushes), Full House asks nothing less than that we reconceptualize our view of life in a fundamental way.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>The human mind has a trusty device for simplifying a complex world: reduce to averages and identify trends. Although valuable, the risk is that we ignore variations and end up with a skewed view of reality. In evolutionary terms, the result is a view in which humans are the inevitable pinnacle of evolutionary progress, instead of, as Stephen Jay Gould patiently argues, &#34;a cosmic accident that would never arise again if the tree of life could be replanted.&#34; The implications of Gould&#39;s argument may threaten certain of our philosophical and religious foundations but will in the end provide us with a clearer view of, and a greater appreciation for, the complexities of our world.Stephen Jay Gould is an internationally renowned evolutionary biologist and best-selling author, equally respected by academic and general interest readers. His books for the general reader include seven collections of essays (written for his monthly column in Natural History magazine, which he has done for over twenty years) and three original nonfiction works.

The accession of Charles V, with his vast dominions in both the old and new worlds, was the occasion for a renewal of the myth of Empire in the West.

Just let it go.&#x201d;</p><p>Not only could they hear the music blaring from next door; they could feel it. The deep bass was pulsing through the walls of their house like a heartbeat.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s eleven o&#x2019;clock, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Richard said, turning on his bedside table lamp. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s Wednesday. Not Friday night or Saturday night, but Wednesday.&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys had lived in this modest Milford home, on this hundred-year-old street with its mature trees, for nearly thirty years. They&#x2019;d seen neighbors come and go. The good, and the bad. But never had there been anything as bad as this, and it had been going on for a while. Two years back, the owner of the house next door started renting it to students attending Housatonic Community College over in Bridgeport, and since then the neighborhood had gone, as Richard Bradley liked to proclaim on a daily basis, &#x201c;to hell in a handcart.&#x201d;</p><p>Some of the students had been worse than others. This bunch, they took the cake. Loud music nearly every night. The smell of marijuana wafting in through the windows. Shattered beer bottles on the sidewalk.</p><p>This used to be a nice part of town. Young couples with their first homes, some starting families. There were some older teenagers on the street, to be sure, but if any of them acted up, threw a raucous party when they were left on their own, at least you could rat them out the next day to their parents and it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again. At least not for a while. There were older people on the street, too, many of them retired. Like the Bradleys, who&#x2019;d taught in schools in and around Milford since the 1970s before packing it in.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that what we worked so hard for our whole lives?&#x201d; he asked Esther. &#x201c;So we could live next door to a bunch of goddamn rabble-rousers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll stop soon,&#x201d; she said, sitting up in bed. &#x201c;They usually do at some point. We were young, too, once.&#x201d; She grimaced. &#x201c;A long time ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like an earthquake that won&#x2019;t end,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what the hell kind of music that is. What is that?&#x201d;</p><p>He stood up, grabbed his bathrobe, which was thrown over a chair, knotted the sash in front.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to give yourself a heart attack,&#x201d; Esther said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go over every time this happens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a couple of minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she said as he strode out of the bedroom. Esther Bradley threw back the covers, put on her own robe, slid her feet into the slippers on the floor by the bed, and went running down the stairs after her husband.</p><p>By the time she caught up with him, he was on the front porch. She noticed, for the first time, that he had nothing on his feet. She tried to grab his arm to stop him but he jerked it away, and she felt a twinge of pain in her shoulder. He went down the steps, walked down to the sidewalk, turned left, and kept marching until he reached the driveway next door. He could have taken a shortcut across the grass, but it was still wet from a shower earlier in the evening.</p><p>&#x201c;Richard,&#x201d; she said pleadingly, a few steps behind him. She wasn&#x2019;t going to leave him alone. She figured there was less likelihood that these young men would do anything to him if they saw her standing there. Would they punch out an old man while his wife watched?</p><p>He was a man on a mission, mounting the steps to the front door of the three-story Victorian home. Most of the lights were on, many of the windows open, the music blaring out for all the neighbors to hear. But it wasn&#x2019;t loud enough to drown out the sounds of raised voices and laughter.</p><p>Richard banged on the door, his wife stationed at the bottom of the porch steps, watching anxiously.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to say?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>He ignored her and banged on the door again. He was about to strike it with the heel of his fist a third time when the door swung open. A thin man, maybe twenty, just over six feet tall, dressed in jeans and a plain dark blue T-shirt and holding a can of Coors in his hand, stood there.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. He blinked woozily a couple of times as he sized up his visitor. Bradley&#x2019;s few wisps of gray hair were sticking up at all angles, his bathrobe had started to part in front, and his eyes were bugging out.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Bradley shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; the man said, bewildered.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re keeping up the whole damn neighborhood!&#x201d;</p><p>The man&#x2019;s mouth formed an O, as if trying to take it in. He looked beyond the man and saw Esther Bradley, holding her hands together, almost in prayer.</p><p>She said, sounding almost apologetic, &#x201c;The music is a bit loud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah, shit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re from next door, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Richard said, shaking his head. &#x201c;I was over here last week, and the week before that! You got any brain cells left?&#x201d;</p><p>The young man blinked a couple more times, then turned and shouted back into the house, &#x201c;Hey, turn it down. Carter! Hey, Carter! Turn it&#x2014;yeah, turn it the fuck down, will ya!&#x201d;</p><p>Three seconds later, the music stopped, the sudden silence jarring.</p><p>The young man shrugged apologetically, said, &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He extended his free hand. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Brian. Or have I told you that before?&#x201d;</p><p>Richard Bradley ignored the hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to come in for a beer or something?&#x201d; Brian asked, cheerily raising the bottle in his hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some pizza, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Richard said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for the offer,&#x201d; Esther said cheerily.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re, like, the people in that house, right?&#x201d; Brian asked, pointing.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Esther said.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Well, sorry about the noise and everything. We all had this test today and we were kind of unwinding, you know? If we get out of hand again, just come over and bang on the door and we&#x2019;ll try to dial it down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve been doing,&#x201d; Richard said. </p><p>Brian shrugged, then slipped back into the house and closed the door.</p><p>Esther said, &#x201c;He seems like a nice young man.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard grunted.</p><p>They returned to their house, the front door slightly ajar from when they&#x2019;d run out of it in a hurry. It wasn&#x2019;t until they were both inside and had closed and bolted the door, that they noticed the two people sitting in the living room.</p><p>A man and woman. Late thirties, early forties. Both smartly dressed in jeans&#x2014;was that a crease in hers?&#x2014;and lightweight jackets.</p><p>Esther let out a short, startled scream when she spotted them.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Richard said. &#x201c;How the hell did you&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t leave your door open like that,&#x201d; said the woman, getting up from the couch. She wasn&#x2019;t much more than five-two, maybe five-three. Short black hair, worn in a bob. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not smart,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even in a nice neighborhood like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call the police,&#x201d; Richard Bradley said to his wife.</p><p>It took a moment for the command to register. But when it did, she started for the kitchen. The moment she moved, the man shot up off the couch. He was a good foot taller than the woman, stocky, and swift. He crossed the room in an instant and blocked her path.</p><p>He grabbed her roughly by her bony shoulders, spun her around, and tossed her, hard, into a living room chair.</p><p>She yelped.</p><p>&#x201c;You son of a bitch!&#x201d; Richard Bradley said and charged at the man while he was turned away from him. He made a fist and pounded it into the intruder&#x2019;s back, just below the neck. The man spun around and swatted Richard away as if he was a child. As he stumbled back, the man glanced down, saw Richard&#x2019;s bare foot, and drove the heel of his shoe down onto it.</p><p>Bradley shouted out in pain and collapsed toward the couch, catching the edge and falling onto the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; the woman said. She said to her partner, &#x201c;Sweetheart, you want to turn down some of these lights? It&#x2019;s awfully bright in here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, found the light switch, and flicked it down.</p><p>&#x201c;My foot,&#x201d; Richard whimpered. &#x201c;You broke my goddamn foot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me help him,&#x201d; Esther said. &#x201c;Let me get him an ice pack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay put,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>The woman perched her butt on the edge of the coffee table, where she could easily address Esther or look down to the floor to Richard.</p><p>She said this:</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask the two of you a question, and I&#x2019;m only going to ask it once. So I want you to <i>listen</i> very carefully, and then I want you to <i>think</i> very carefully about how you answer. What I do not want you to do is answer my question with a question. That would be very, very unproductive. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys glanced at each other, terrified, then looked back at the woman. Their heads bobbed up and down weakly in understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very good,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;So, pay attention. It&#x2019;s a very simple question.&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys waited.</p><p>The woman said, &#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d;</p><p>The words hung there for a moment, no one making a sound.</p><p>After several seconds, Richard said, &#x201c;Where is wh&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>Then cut himself off when he saw the look in the woman&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>She smiled and waved a finger at him. &#x201c;Tut, tut, I warned you about that. You almost did it, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Richard swallowed. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you answer the question? Again, you need to know that Eli says it&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard&#x2019;s lips trembled. He shook his head and stammered, &#x201c;I&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The woman raised a palm, silencing him, and turned her attention to Esther. &#x201c;Would you like to answer the question?&#x201d;</p><p>Esther was careful with her phrasing. &#x201c;I would appreciate it if you could be more specific. I&#x2014;I have to tell you that name&#x2014;Eli? I don&#x2019;t know anyone by that name. Whatever it is you want, if we have it, we&#x2019;ll give it to you.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman sighed and turned her head to her partner, who was standing a couple of feet away.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you your chance,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;I told you I&#x2019;d only ask once.&#x201d; Just then, the house next door began to thump once again with loud music. The windows of the Bradley house began to vibrate. The woman smiled and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Drake. I like him.&#x201d; She glanced up at the man and said, &#x201c;Shoot the husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No!&#x201d; Esther screamed.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Richard shouted. &#x201c;Just tell us what&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Before the retired teacher could finish the sentence, the man had reached into his jacket for a gun, pointed it downward, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Esther opened her mouth to scream again, but no sound came out. Little more than a high-pitched squeak, as though someone had stepped on a mouse.</p><p>The woman said to her, &#x201c;I guess you really don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She nodded at her associate, and he fired a second shot.</p><p>Wearily, she said to him, &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s not here. We&#x2019;ve got a long night ahead of us, sweetheart, unless it&#x2019;s in the cookie jar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We should be so lucky,&#x201d; he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>TERRY</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know where I got the idea that once you&#x2019;ve come through a very dark time, after you&#x2019;ve confronted the worst possible demons and defeated them, that everything&#x2019;s going to be just fine.</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t work that way.</p><p>Not that life wasn&#x2019;t better for us, at least for a while. Seven years ago, things were pretty bad around here. Bad as they can get. People died. My wife and daughter and I came close to being among them. But when it was over, and we were whole, and still had each other, well, we did like the song says. We picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and started all over again.</p><p>More or less.</p><p>But the scars remained. We went through our own version of post-traumatic stress. My wife, Cynthia, certainly did. She&#x2019;d lost all the members of her family when she was fourteen&#x2014;I really mean <i>lost</i>; her parents and her brother vanished into thin air one night&#x2014;and Cynthia had to wait twenty-five years to learn their fate. When it was all over, there were no joyful reunions.</p><p>There was more. Cynthia&#x2019;s aunt paid the ultimate price in her bid to shine the light on a decades-old secret. And then there was Vince Fleming, a career criminal who was also just a kid when Cynthia&#x2019;s family vanished, who&#x2019;d been with her that night. Twenty-five years later, against his own nature, he helped us find out what really happened. Like they say, no good deed goes unpunished. He got shot and nearly died for his trouble.</p><p>You might have heard about it. It was all over the news. They were even going to make a movie about it at one point, but that fell through, which, if you ask me, was for the best.</p><p>We thought we&#x2019;d be able to close the book on that chapter of our lives. Questions were answered; mysteries were solved. The bad people died, or went to prison.</p><p>Case closed, as they say.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s like a horrible tsunami. You think it&#x2019;s over, but debris is washing ashore half a world away years later.</p><p>For Cynthia, the trauma never ended. Every day, she feared history repeating itself with the family she had now. Me. And our daughter, Grace. The trouble was, the steps she took to make sure it wouldn&#x2019;t led us into that area known as the law of unintended consequence: the actions you take to achieve one thing often produce the exact opposite result.</p><p>Cynthia&#x2019;s efforts to keep our fourteen-year-old daughter, Grace, safe from the big, bad world were pushing the child to experience it as quickly as she could.</p><p>I kept hoping we&#x2019;d eventually work our way through the darkness and come out the other side. But it didn&#x2019;t look as though it was going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>GRACE and her mother had shouting matches on a pretty much daily basis.</p><p>They were all variations on a theme.</p><p>Grace ignored curfew. Grace didn&#x2019;t call when she got to where she was going. Grace said she was going to one friend&#x2019;s house but ended up going to another and didn&#x2019;t update her mother. Grace wanted to go to a concert in New York but wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get home until two in the morning. Mom said no.</p><p>I tried to be a peacemaker in these disputes, usually with little success. I&#x2019;d tell Cynthia privately that I understood her motives, that I didn&#x2019;t want anything bad to happen to Grace, either, but that if our daughter was never allowed any freedom, she&#x2019;d never learn to cope in the world on her own.</p><p>These fights generally ended with someone storming out of a room. A door being slammed. Grace telling Cynthia she hated her, then knocking over a chair as she left the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;God, she&#x2019;s just like me,&#x201d; Cynthia would often say. &#x201c;I was a horror show at that age. I just don&#x2019;t want her making the same mistakes I made.&#x201d;</p><p>Cynthia, even now, thirty-two years later, carried a lot of guilt from the night her mother and father and older brother, Todd, disappeared. Part of her still believed that if she hadn&#x2019;t been out with a boy named Vince, without her parents&#x2019; permission or knowledge, and if she hadn&#x2019;t gotten drunk and passed out once she&#x2019;d fallen into her own bed, she might have known what was happening and, somehow, saved those closest to her.</p><p>Even though the facts didn&#x2019;t bear that out, Cynthia believed she&#x2019;d been...</p></p><h2>Holbein in England</h2><p>Hans Holbein&#x2019;s prolific production of precise and realistic portraits of the great figures of the 16th century earned him an international reputation in his own time. Although Holbein (1497&#x2013;1543) gained high acclaim while working in Switzerland, his periods in England, where he became the official artist at the court of King Henry VIII, proved equally important in establishing his reputation. Susan Foister, a leading expert on Holbein, considers the way in which England both influenced and was influenced by the artist and his work.

Javier Marias has received numerous literary prizes including the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the Prix Formentor. He lives and works as a translator and columnist in Madrid.The first US appearance of an accomplished and elegant novel, first published in Spain in 1990, by the author of A Heart So White (p. 18) and other highly praised fiction. Set in Oxford, and drenched in the ambience of academic myopia and departmental power politics, it recounts in polished Jamesian prose the two-year lectureship enjoyed and endured there by its narrator, a visiting Spanish scholar. He encounters an alluring married woman tutor whose affair with him piques her conscience rather less than it does his. She, in fact, can't even be bothered to keep silent about their intimacy. Other complications are provided by a richly observed bevy of colleagues who exhibit most of the commoner academic and British eccentricities (notable among them are an economist who will discourse at length about his obsession with an 18th-century cider tax, and a professor of literature who moonlights as a successful author of ``horror blockbusters''). There's little plot beyond the (unnamed) narrator's romantic intriguing, but it's a rare civilized pleasure to overhear his incisive analyses of cultural, temperamental, and sexual differences between Britons and Iberians, or to follow his peregrinations through the meaner streets of Oxford (whose beggars elicit a feeling of kinship in this deracinated wanderer) or several antiquarian bookstores, ever in search of the odd and engaging. The novel is as much a record of life at Oxford as it is a narrative. Its characters, though vividly drawn, are really little more than functional, especially as measured against Mar�as's only real character creation here: his thoughtful protagonist, whose confusions and insights alike more often than not sparkle with the brilliance of aphorism (``In Oxford the only thing anyone is truly interested in is money, followed some way behind by information, which can always be useful as a means of acquiring money'')--translated with deadpan clarity and precision by the ever-dependable Costa. Another stunning work from one of Europe's best younger writers. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Only 4:30, and the afternoon sky was already dark. It had been snowing all week and the toboggan run at the end of his street was perfectly packed. But there was no way his mother would let him go out sledding alone tonight, and his dad would be working late at the store, as he had every night since the beginning of December. </p><p> Cold water seeped in over the top of his boot as he tried, but failed, to clear a huge slush puddle near the curb. Evan longed for spring. He imagined the big green field behind his house, freshly mowed -- perfect for an after-dinner baseball game. He thought about how his dad always made sure to leave work early so they could play a game of catch before dinner. Stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, Evan closed his eyes, letting the thick snowflakes melt on his lids. He pictured sunshine, white fluffy clouds, new green leaves against a bright blue sky. He opened his eyes. Bare tree branches stood in black silhouette against the overcast sky and piles of snow -- turned gray and sooty by traffic -- slopped up and over the curbs. Evan sighed, feeling as though spring might never come again. </p><p> With cold water squishing in his boot at each step, Evan turned onto Main Street. The little shops lining both sides of the street were bustling with people rushing in and out, their arms full of bags and packages. Dark-green pine garland twisted around the poles of the streetlights, which were just beginning to flicker on. Small white lights framed the windows of some shops, while bright red and green flashing lights bordered the doorways of others. Cars moved slowly down the street, carefully navigating around the many shoppers crossing the road. </p><p> Above the street, stars outlined in tiny white lights hung on cables stretched from one side to the other. Main Street glowed with Christmas spirit, as if to cancel out the advancing darkness of the winter afternoon. But Evan's mood was as gloomy as the snow clouds piling up in the late afternoon sky, and the blazing lights and cheerful decorations did nothing to lift his spirits. </p><p> In fact, as far as Evan was concerned, the whole Christmas thing was completely out of control. </p><p> Take the annual Holidayle Elementary School Christmas pageant, for instance. Evan's class had had to stay late to work on their number. Even though the performance for the whole school was tomorrow, half the class still couldn't remember their lines, and the other half only wanted to talk about all the presents they were expecting to get on Christmas, which was just three days away. </p><p> Evan had made the mistake of saying that he'd hoped Santa would bring him a new CD player for his room, and a couple of the sixth graders had overheard. They had teased him mercilessly before hurling him into the snow banks outside of school. Not because of the CD player, but for saying he'd hoped Santa would bring it. Evan finally said he just pretended to believe because of his little sister, but even as he said it, it felt like a betrayal. The idea of Santa -- who Evan pictured as taller and thinner, kind of like Professor Dumbledore from Harry Potter, only in long red robes -- was one of the few things Evan thought was really special about Christmas. Santa -- and Christmas carols. </p><p> Evan loved Christmas carols. Listening to songs like "Silent Night" or "White Christmas" gave him a warm feeling that started in his chest and spread through his whole body. He knew all the words to all the songs that had to do with Christmas, and he loved to sing them. To Evan, they were like magical incantations that conjured up the very season. </p><p> Sure, some of them made no sense at all, like "Here We Come a'Wassailing." He thought that maybe wassailing was some winter sport, like parasailing, only in the snow. But it didn't really matter what it was about -- he still loved the song. </p><p> Evan began to hum as he walked down the street. By the time he'd worked his way through "Joy to the World," he was feeling a little better. At the end of Main Street, Evan saw another Christmas sight that made him smile. He broke into a jog and crossed over to the parking lot next to the local pharmacy and market. </p><p> The parking lot was empty of cars. At the far end, an old camper with a flat trailer attached to the back was pulled up next to the building. A little distance from the trailer, a metal barrel that had been sawed in half held a small wood fire. Two large logs sat on either side to serve as chairs. From the middle of the lot to the sidewalk, rows and rows of fresh-cut fir trees leaned against sawhorses. Evan walked between the rows of trees, admiring how the fresh snow tipped their branches. The tall trees screened out the bustle and noise of the streets beyond, and Evan imagined he was deep in a forest. </p><p> "Merry Christmas, Evan." </p><p> Evan jumped at the sound of the voice, even though he expected it. </p><p> "Hey, Leon." Evan turned around and smiled. "Merry Christmas to you." </p><p> Leon Tannenbaum was the most unusual-looking grown-up Evan had ever seen. He was thin and small, not much taller than Evan, and had shocking red hair that stuck out in random tufts from under his tattered winter hat. He had twinkling blue eyes that all but disappeared in a web of wrinkles and creases when he smiled, which was almost constantly. He wore many layers of brightly colored winter clothes, not seeming to mind that the bright green stripes on his pants competed for attention with the bold red and white diamonds on his sweater. He completed his costume with several gaily striped scarves wrapped around his neck and gloves with the fingers cut off. </p><p> Every year since Evan could remember, Leon Tannenbaum and his trailer of fresh-cut trees had pulled into Holidayle a few days before Christmas and set up shop in the parking lot. Evan's family had never bought a tree from Leon. Instead, Evan's dad always insisted on following the family tradition of marching out into the woods behind their house, cutting down a fresh tree, and dragging it home. Still, Evan looked forward to seeing Leon every year, and Leon never seemed to mind that Evan wasn't a customer -- he always seemed genuinely glad to see him. </p><p> "Got a new CD to lure the customers in," Leon said, grinning widely. He knew Evan loved music and they often compared notes on their favorite versions of Christmas songs. Leon ran over to the large boom box that sat on a makeshift table near the sidewalk, twisted the volume to high, and stood expectantly, his head cocked to one side as a lush melody filled the air. </p><p> "It's a medieval carol," he said, waving a hand in the air in time to the music. </p><p> Evan had never heard anything like it. He listened and heard strings and bells and maybe a flute. When the singers came on, Evan couldn't understand the language they were singing in, but it didn't matter. He closed his eyes and let the music swirl around him. Breathing deeply, he smelled pine trees and wood smoke and fresh snow. </p><p> "It's what Christmas is all about, isn't it?" Leon said softly. </p><p> Evan opened his eyes and nodded. "It's perfect," he agreed. "But I can't understand what they're singing." </p><p> "It's in Latin," Leon explained. "An ancient language for an ancient holiday." </p><p> Evan tried to picture an ancient Christmas -- a celebration in a time before electric tree lights and shopping malls. Frankly, he couldn't imagine what people ever did. </p><p> "Have you got time for a cup of hot cocoa?" Leon motioned toward a thermos sitting next to the boom box. </p><p> "Not today," Evan said. "I'm already late. My mom probably has about a million things for me to do -- just 'cuz it's Christmas. You know how it is." </p><p> "I'll take a snow check then," Leon said, waving good-bye. </p><p><br> Evan jogged down the street. He could get home a lot quicker if he cut through the woods behind the parking lot -- his house was right on the other side. But it was already dark, and the woods were hard enough to navigate in the snow in daylight. Sticking to the main roads, he soon arrived home. </p><p> The white colonial house sat on the last lot at the end of a dead-end street. There was no missing it; Evan's mom had gone nuts decorating for the holiday. Huge evergreen wreaths swathed in red ribbon hung from the upstairs windows, illuminated by floodlights set into the lawn. Another enormous wreath decorated the front door. Electric candles glowed in all the windows facing the street. The lamppost at the edge of the lawn was wrapped in red-and-white to look like a candy cane, and wire sculptures of reindeer, wrapped in little white lights, were posed along the path leading up to the house. </p><p> Going around the side, Evan let himself in the back door and dropped his backpack on the kitchen floor with a thud. His mother stood at the open door to the oven, shoveling trays of cookies onto the wire racks. She didn't even turn around. His younger sister, Elyse, was sitting at the kitchen table frosting gingerbread men as if they were on an assembly line: swipe the frosting, stick on two raisins for eyes, three cinnamon dots for buttons, move to another tray. She never looked up from the rows of cookies, lined up like soldiers at attention. </p><p> Evan pulled off his knit cap and scratched his head until his brown hair stood up in spikes on the top of his head. He hated the itchy wool hat with its snowflake pattern and matching mittens, but his grandma sent him an identical set every year for Christmas. Dropping the hat and mittens on a chair next to the door, he shrugged out of his parka. He inhaled deeply. The spicy smell of gingerbread filled his nostrils. Okay, so maybe there was something else to appreciate about the Christmas season -- his mom never baked like this at any other time of year. He walked over to the island in the center of the kitchen and broke the leg off a cooling gingerbread man. </p><p> "Mooooom! He's eating the gingerbread men!" Elyse shrieked. With sticky fingers, she snatched the half-eaten leg out of Evan's hand. </p><p> "Evan James Darling!" His mother nearly dropped the tray of cookies she was putting into the oven. "Those are for the second-grade party tomorrow!" </p><p> "Sorry," Evan mumbled, crumbs spraying out of his mouth. </p><p> "You're about to be very sorry, young man," his mother snapped, staring pointedly at the puddles of melted snow that dotted the kitchen floor and pooled around Evan's boots. She pushed her light brown bangs back, leaving a trail of flour across her forehead. She was wearing an apron that was decorated with Christmas trees and teddy bears, but she didn't look very festive. She looked hot and tired. </p><p> Behind her mother's back, Elyse stuck her tongue out at Evan and went back to decorating. </p><p> "Sorry," Evan said again, trying to slip out of his boots without dripping any more water on the floor. </p><p> Evan's older sister, Kelly, came to the door of the kitchen, pointed to her mother, and held her finger to her lips. </p><p> "Be quiet," she mouthed. </p><p> Kelly was already dressed in her parka and was carrying her boots. As she began to tiptoe toward the back door, Evan and Elyse watched her silently cross behind their mother's back. Kelly put her hand on the doorknob and began to open the door slowly. </p><p> "Where are you going, young lady?" Evan's mother didn't even turn around. She just bent down and put another tray of gingerbread into the oven. </p><p> "To the mall. I need to get a present for Mitch." </p><p> Mitch was Kelly's boyfriend, and as far as Evan could tell, the only thing she cared about besides how her hair looked. </p><p> "I thought you got Mitch a sweater." </p><p> "He can't use a sweater in Mexico," Kelly said. "I thought I'd try to find him a snorkel at the sports shop. It's not too late for me to look for a new bathing suit, either." </p><p> Evan began inching out of the room. He knew what was coming. Kelly had been begging their parents to allow her to go away with Mitch and his family. They were leaving on Christmas Eve day and wouldn't be home until two days after Christmas. Mitch's family went on a different vacation every year at Christmastime. Evan had overheard Mitch's dad saying that Christmas was just a long weekend off from work, and they might as well take advantage of it and go somewhere really great. Mitch told Evan that they had gone to Mexico once before and that it was really hot, and he'd spent all Christmas Day in the pool and playing his GameBoy in the hotel room. </p><p> Kelly had been pestering their parents about this trip since the beginning of December. </p><p> "What's wrong with wanting to do something different for Christmas for a change? Why do we always have to do the same things?" </p><p> "We've discussed this over and over again, Kelly. You're not going away over Christmas. It's a time to be with family." Evan's mother always started out calmly. </p><p> "And friends. And loved ones," Kelly pointed out. </p><p> "And <i>family.</i>" Evan's mother turned around to face Kelly. </p><p> <i>Please,</i> Evan thought, <i>don't roll your eyes.</i> </p><p> Kelly rolled her eyes. </p><p> "You've been to the mall every day for the last two weeks. I could use a little help here," his mother continued. </p><p> <i>Don't say "whatever,</i>" Evan silently pleaded. </p><p> "What<i>ever,</i>" Kelly said sullenly. </p><p> Evan winced. </p><p> "That's it. Take off that coat," Evan's mother's voice rose. "You're going to stay right here tonight and help us finish up some Christmas chores." </p><p> Kelly shrugged out of her coat and slumped into a kitchen chair. She began eating the raisins that Elyse was using for eyes. </p><p> Christmas chores, thought Evan. That's all this dumb holiday is good for. A bunch of things that you're supposed to want to do just because they're called <i>traditions:</i> chop down trees, bring 'em inside, string them with lights, make eggnog, shop all the time until you've bought tons of stuff that no one wants -- like socks and underwear -- drag in holly and pine garland, decorate the house. </p><p> Evan frowned as he remembered the worst Christmas tradition of all: the ball of mistletoe. </p><p> Last year Amanda Rose, who lived across the street, had planted a big kiss right on Evan's lips. Evan had stood there frozen -- turning as red as the velvet ribbon decorating the banister in the hallway, where she had trapped him -- as all the adults laughed. He shuddered and rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. </p><p> <i>Traditions, phooey. What's the point of them anyway? Why not just celebrate Christmas in a new way every year? Maybe Mitch's family is on to something.</i> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Mannheim Steamroller</p></p><h2>Recognitions</h2><p><p><strong>A great masterpiece by William Gaddis, with a new introduction by William H. Gass.</strong></p>The book Jonathan Franzen dubbed the � ur-text of postwar � ction� and the � � rst great cultural critique, which, even if Heller and Pynchon hadn� t read it while composing <em>Catch-22</em> and <em>V.</em>, managed to anticipate the spirit of both� � <em>The Recognitions</em> is a masterwork about art and forgery, and the increasingly thin line between the counterfeit and the fake. Gaddis anticipates by almost half a century the crisis of reality that we currently face, where the real and the virtual are combining in alarming ways, and the sources of legitimacy and power are often obscure to us.</p><p>William Gaddis (1922-98) stands among the greatest American writers of the twentieth century. The winner of two National Book Awards (for &#34;J R&#34; [1976] and &#34;A Frolic of His Own&#34; [1995]), he wrote five novels during his lifetime, including &#34;Carpenter&#39;s Gothic &#34;(1985), &#34;Agap? Agape&#34; (published posthumously in 2002), and his early masterpiece &#34;The Recognitions&#34; (1955). He is loved and admired for his stylistic innovations, his unforgettable characters, his pervasive humor, and the breadth of his intellect and vision."The novel is like a huge landscape painting of modern New York, peopled with hundreds of doomed but energetic little figures, executed on wood panels by Brueghel or Bosch, and looking incongruously ancient beneath layers of yellowed lacquer. Even the blue skies in the book (the phrase "Another blue day" recurs as a despair-inducing leitmotiv) glow like oil-paint skies in an art museum..." (<i>Jonathan Franzen, The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Recognitions</i> is always spoken of as the most overlooked important work of the last several literary generations... Through the famous obscurity of <i>The Recognitions</i>, Mr. Gaddis has become famous for not being famous enough." (<i>Cynthia Ozick</i>)<br><br>"[<i>The Recognitions</i>] seems as relevant as ever. For who would dare say that we no longer live in a world in which people 'exchange forgeries of what the heart dare not surrender?' The problem of authenticity in all its forms is always with us, and in reading this extraordinary book we are constantly freed into recognitions &#x2015; re-cognitions &#x2015; of many aspects, of the problem, which have deteriorated into non-cognitions in our mass media age. William Gaddis detects forgery at all levels, but in doing so he has forged a classic."

During his early years as an architect, he supplemented his income by dealing in Japanese art, earning tens of thousands of dollars from sales, often at highly inflated prices, to private collectors, museums, and clients for whom he had built homes. In this meticulously researched, lavishly illustrated account, Wright's mercenary impulse is laid alongside his genuine passion for Japonisme, culminating in a 1919 episode in which, duped by a Tokyo dealer, he wound up selling forged and retouched prints to his best customers. His reputation forever damaged, he responded by ignoring his mounting debts and buying Japanese art only for himself. <br> Copyright � 2005 <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>John Pawson: Plain Space</h2><p>ohn Pawson is an architect and designer whose exceptional work combines an essential simplicity with a keen attention to the details of everyday life and human experience. His pared-down yet luxurious houses and art galleries were his first projects to gain international attention, and his work has since included Calvin Klein's flagship store in New York, airport lounges for Cathay Pacific, and a kitchen for Obumex. In the last decade, the scope of his designs has broadened from objects and interiors to include houses, monasteries, pavilions and boats. This change in scale has given his office the opportunity to refine its minimalist aesthetic and further develop its ideas of a fundamental architecture based on the qualities of space, proportion, light and materials. Frequently these projects intervene in existing conditions to create spaces that are simultaneously simple and complex, timeless and contemporary: in the Novy Dvur Monastery in the Czech Republic, elements of the original baroque complex are combined with entirely new architecture to create a mysterious and beautiful sequence of spaces, and in the Baron House in Sweden the vernacular language of the area is refined and abstracted to create a truly modern home. In <i>Plain Space</i>, author Alison Morris presents both this recent body of work and earlier projects from the perspective of someone who has had unique access to the work and archives of the office. In thematic essays and narrative project descriptions she examines the firm's working processes, relationship with clients, and approach to design. These insights into how Pawson and his office approach all different kinds of projects, including a cricket pavilion, a ballet stage set, apartment and boat interiors, will be of interest to architects, students, and anyone looking to simplify and beautify their own living space. Filled with exquisite photographs and detailed drawings, <i>Plain Space</i> will be the next must-have book for fans of John Pawson and a perfect introduction to his work for anyone interested in the absolute best of contemporary design.</p><p>Alison Morris is a writer, specializing in the field of architecture and design. In 1998 she joined the Pawson team, where she has remained close to the heart of the architectural process for more than a decade.

In Discovering the Unknown Landscape, Ann Vileisis presents a fascinating look at that history, exploring how Americans have thought about and used wetlands from colonial times through the present day. She discusses the many factors that influence patterns of land use - ideology, economics, law, perception, art - and examines the complicated interactions among those factors that have resulted in our contemporary landscape. As well as chronicling the march of destruction, Vileisis considers the seemingly contradictory tradition of appreciating wetlands: artistic and literary representations, conservation during the Progressive Era, and recent legislation aimed at slowing or stopping losses.</p><p>"Though I have focused my entire professional career on wetlands, this book provided me with new information, insight, and appreciation of our wetlands resource. There is no student of wetlands that cannot benefit from reading this book." (Bill O. Wilen <i>Project Leader, National Wetlands Inventory</i>)<br><br>"Vileisis gives us the cultural history of America's wetlands in intricate detail, from Henry David Thoreau, neck deep in a cranberry bog, gaining 'a sense of the richness of life,' to senators' jockeys over the Swamp Land Act in 1849." (<i><i>Smithsonian</i></i>)<br><br>" ...a fine survey of changing American attitudes towards wetlands, and of the struggles that have been fought for their protection. It will become a standard work on its subject." (William Cronon, University of Wisconsin, author of "Nature's Metropolis")<br><br>"A rare book that goes beyond description to contribute to our understanding of the land and of American culture." (<i><i>Chicago Free Press</i></i>)<br><br>"A simply first-rate piece of environmental history&#x2014;comprehensive and careful in its research, well reasoned in its analysis, and exceptionally well-written. Vileisis has provided a model as to how environmental history can markedly enhance how we understand the environmental present and how we think about the future." (Samuel P. Hays <i>Professor Emeritus of History, University of Pittsburgh</i>)<br><br>"In this timely, well-documented work, environmental historian Vileisis explains the confusion and contention surrounding wetlands preservation in terms of the differing cultural values Americans have historically assigned to these problematic habitats. . . . From salt marshes of Colonial New England to the recent efforts to restore the Florida Everglades, Vileisis discusses not only the changes in common practices, laws, and regulations but also the shifts in cultural and social attitudes. Highly recommended. . . . " (<i><i>Library Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"...a major addition to the literature of American environmental history." (Roderick Nash <i>author of <i>Wilderness and the American Mind</i></i>)Whether seen as "bugs and mud" or as breeding grounds for countless species of fish, birds and other organisms, wetlands have borne much of the brunt of our development as a nation, argues environmental historian and naturalist Vileisis. Here, her painstaking research into the changing ways people thought, wrote about and thereby legislated wetlands throughout the many stages of the country's development makes a compelling case for their central role in our history. Vileisis takes us through our many uses of wetlands resources, from the filling of Boston's marshes, early rice-milling dams and the travels in search of "`rare and Useful productions'" of 18th-century botanist William Bartram, to the "great Florida land giveaway" of the 1870s and the over-logging of Southern swamps. Nearly two thirds of the book deals with our own century, including the formation of the Army Corp of Engineers (and their rise to power in controlling wetlands alteration) and the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act in the late 1960s, as well as the expanding role of concerned citizens in policy making after WWII. Along the way, Vileisis shows how America's explosive population growth and subsequent housing development decimated the habitats of waterfowl as well as those of other species. In her fine book, Vileisis provides a comprehensive account of a not so slow-motion natural disaster.

She would have called the police or, at the very least, screamed if he hadn&#x2019;t been so damned beautiful.</p><p>Instead, without so much as a blink, she fumbled for the electric kettle and poured boiling water over the loose tea leaves in the silver strainer. Quite a bit of water missed the mug, went onto the granite countertop, and ran down to the tile floor, but she didn&#x2019;t notice.</p><p>It was so early that it wasn&#x2019;t yet daylight, and she hadn&#x2019;t bothered to turn on the kitchen lights. But then he&#x2019;d turned on the porch lights, and in the misty morning, as she looked through the screen door, it was almost as though he were on a stage.</p><p>He&#x2019;d dropped his T-shirt and sweatpants on the stone path, then, totally nude and facing Casey, he walked up the three steps, his full male glory in view. He came straight toward her, as though he meant to enter the house.</p><p>Casey had just woken up, and when she first saw him, she thought she was still asleep and having the best dream of her life. Not only was his body beautiful, but so was his face. Hair, eyes, beard stubble, truly luscious lips. His skin was a dark golden color all over, and he had long, sleek muscles. His hair was long, down his neck, and in the overhead light it was so black that it seemed to glisten almost blue.</p><p>When he got to the porch, he didn&#x2019;t open the screen door and come inside. Instead, he turned so she had a glorious view of his side.</p><p>Lord! Pecs. Abs. The curve of his backside, thighs like an Olympic skater&#x2019;s.</p><p>Casey managed to blink a few times. Surely she was asleep. Surely he couldn&#x2019;t be&nbsp;<i>real</i>.</p><p>He seemed to be doing something to the wall, and seconds later it started raining. That made sense. The deity who controlled the heavens&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>look like this man.</p><p>But, no, it was an outdoor shower that seemed to be attached to her little guesthouse. She hadn&#x2019;t noticed that it was there&#x2014;for the few months she&#x2019;d been in town, it had been winter. But yesterday had been so warm that she&#x2019;d opened every door and window to let out the heat of her cooking. When she at last went to bed, the kitchen had been so hot that she&#x2019;d just hooked the screen door and left the room open to the breezes.</p><p>She picked up her mug of tea and sipped it while she watched him lather himself with soap.</p><p>There was a tall stool near her, and without taking her eyes off him, she felt for it and sat down. As he ran his hands over his body, she was even more sure that she was dreaming. And she was just as sure that if she took her eyes off him she&#x2019;d wake up.</p><p>She watched him soap his legs, and between them, then he moved upward. He had such trouble reaching the entire width of his back that Casey had thoughts of slipping out of her pajamas and joining him.</p><p>&#x201c;Could I help?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d ask. He wouldn&#x2019;t say a word. He&#x2019;d just hand her the soap and she&#x2019;d get busy.</p><p>Of course, she could use some cleaning too, so he would do her back. Or front. Or wherever he wanted to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it was the way it was dark where she was sitting and so very light where he was that made it all seem like a movie. She sipped her tea and watched him, dreamily smiling at the scene.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been working in the kitchen until midnight and it was very early now. Kit said he wanted the food at the playhouse by eight, and she took that to mean he wanted it set up and ready to serve. Last night she&#x2019;d called her brother Josh to ask if he&#x2019;d please, please find some tables for her. &#x201c;Use sawhorses or tree stumps, whatever your great manliness can find,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said in the voicemail she left for him.&#x201c; Just so I have a place to put all this food. Kit said he&#x2019;s expecting half the town to show up for the auditions. Double please? I&#x2019;ll save you some of those cream-filled doughnut holes you like so much.&#x201d; She said the last in a voice as cajoling as she could make it. Considering that she&#x2019;d been on her feet for fourteen hours, she wondered if she sounded more pathetic than persuasive.</p><p>But looking at the beautiful naked man was making up for yesterday. He was rinsing off now. He reached up to the shower- head on the wall, pulled it down, and began spraying water over his entire gorgeous body.</p><p>Casey held the mug of tea to her lips, frozen in place. All she could do was stare. His long hair was wet, plastered to his skull. His profile showed his strong features&#x2014;and something about it seemed familiar.</p><p>He turned off the water, then looked around for something. He needs a towel, she thought, and it ran through her mind that she could open the door and hand him one.</p><p>When he stepped toward the house as though he meant to enter, her heart seemed to stop. She was more fully awake now and she was aware that she&#x2019;d just spied on a man taking a shower. Not exactly a polite thing to do. She certainly wouldn&#x2019;t like it done to her!</p><p>When he put his hand on the door handle, Casey&#x2019;s heart started pounding. She didn&#x2019;t dare move or he would see her.</p><p>He dropped his hand and went down the steps, picked up his sweatpants, and put them on&#x2014;and she let out her breath. He would never know. Good!</p><p>But as he reached for his shirt, her cellphone rang. It had been charging and she&#x2019;d forgotten it was on the counter. It kept ringing as she reached for it, then she fumbled and hit speakerphone just as it went to voicemail.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, little sis, I used a broadsword to cut down a couple of oaks and hacked out some tables. But I also borrowed a couple from the church. If you want me to pick you and your kettles up in my truck, let me know. If I don&#x2019;t hear from you, I&#x2019;ll see you at eight.&#x201d; He hung up.</p><p>Casey hadn&#x2019;t moved, nor had she taken her eyes off the man. When the phone rang, he&#x2019;d dropped the shirt and turned to look at the door.</p><p>She was almost sure he saw her. She had on her white pajamas, the ones her mom had given her with the print of the dish running away with the spoon and the cow jumping over the moon. Too young for her, and they clung much too tightly to her curvy figure, but they were oh so comforting.</p><p>It had grown lighter outside and she knew she was probably visible inside the dark room. But maybe not. Maybe she could sneak upstairs and pretend she hadn&#x2019;t seen him.</p><p>As quickly as she could, she put her mug down and slid off the stool.</p><p>But she wasn&#x2019;t fast enough. He bounded up the steps and reached the door in seconds. When he tried to open it, the inside hook held.</p><p>Thinking she had a reprieve, Casey took a step toward the living room, but a sound made her turn back.</p><p>The man, naked from hip bones up, put his fist through the screen and unfastened the hook.</p><p>Okay, now she was scared. This man was big and he looked furious. She glanced at her cellphone but it was between her and him. Her little house was set in eleven acres of garden and woodland. If she screamed, no one would hear her.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get it all down?&#x201d; He stepped closer to her.</p><p>His voice was deep&#x2014;and menacing. Maybe if she ran she could reach the front door and get out. But then what? The only house nearby was the big one, and it was empty.</p><p>She put her hands into fists at her sides, took a deep breath, and faced him. Minutes before, his size, the muscles, the sheer masculinity of him had been enticing, but now they seemed threatening. She didn&#x2019;t think she could escape him, but maybe if she didn&#x2019;t back down he&#x2019;d go away.</p><p>&#x201c;I live here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re trespassing.&#x201d;</p><p>He stopped only three feet away. &#x201c;Like hell you do! Who do you work for? Where is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Casey took a step back. What a voice he had! Loud and deep. And what he was asking was thoroughly puzzling. &#x201c;I work for myself. I cater and do private parties.&#x201d;</p><p>He took another step toward her.&#x201c; And this is a sideline? Where are you hiding it?&#x201d;</p><p>Confusion was replacing her fear. &#x201c;What is &#x2018;it&#x2019;? What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>He picked up her cellphone, the charging cord falling away. &#x201c;Please tell me you didn&#x2019;t use&nbsp;<i>this</i>! I think I deserve better than a mobile phone.&#x201d; He put the phone back on the counter, then turned, his eyes roaming up and down her.</p><p>Casey knew she was looking far from her best. Who wanted a gorgeous man to see her wearing pajamas that were perfect for a five-year-old? And her hair was a rat&#x2019;s nest of tangles and probably full of flour and raspberry jam. She&#x2019;d collapsed last night, not bothering to shower.</p><p>Maybe it was pride, but all sense of fear vanished. She put her shoulders back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are but I want you out of my house. Now!&#x201d; She grabbed her phone. &#x201c;I think the sheriff would like to hear about a man stripping on&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>porch and tearing out&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>screen to get inside&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>house and threatening me. Unless you want to be in handcuffs, I suggest you leave immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood there staring at her, saying nothing, but looking shocked. He opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it. Turning, he left the house, the door slamming behind him.</p><p>For a few moments, Casey stood where she was, her nails cutting into her palms as she watched him leave. He didn&#x2019;t stop to pick up his shirt but kept going, turned right, and moved out of sight.</p><p>Suddenly she felt exhausted. She made it into the living room and fell down onto the couch, her heart pounding in her ears. With her head back, she tried to use her breathing to calm herself.</p><p>The man had been so very angry!</p><p>When Kit had given her the little guesthouse to live in, she&#x2019;d thought it was perfect. It had once been the kitchen of an old Virginia plantation, and the huge fireplace that had been used for cooking was in the living room. Years ago someone had added to the building, putting an excellent kitchen to one side and a bed- room and bath upstairs. There was even an herb garden just outside.</p><p>Kit had asked if she minded being so isolated, but Casey said no, that she loved it. The Big House&#x2014;which had been renovated and decorated before she arrived&#x2014;was locked tight and empty. For six years before she came to Summer Hill, she&#x2019;d been the head chef of one of the busiest restaurants in D.C. After the noise and controlled chaos of that place, the quiet of the old plantation had been bliss.</p><p>But this morning had turned scary.</p><p>She was beginning to calm down, and she needed to think about what she was going to do now. All in all, she thought she should call the sheriff and report what had happened&#x2014;including her embarrassing voyeurism.</p><p>She was still holding her phone and she saw that she had a voicemail from Kit. As she touched the screen, her hand was shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Casey, my dear,&#x201d; Kit&#x2019;s strong voice said, &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s late and I hope you&#x2019;ve gone to bed, but I just wanted to tell you that the owner of Tattwell has returned. I know you think I own the place and I apologize for the subterfuge, but my cousin swore me to secrecy. Still, I feel I should warn you in case you see a couple of strange men on the grounds. The owner is Tatton Landers and he&#x2019;s with his best friend, Jack Worth. They are both very nice young men, so I hope you&#x2019;ll welcome them. I must go. I&#x2019;ll see you at the auditions.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey listened to the message twice to try to get all the information it contained. Jack Worth? she thought. That was the name of an actor she really liked. Her last boyfriend had been a fiend for his movies and had all the DVDs. They had never missed a new Jack Worth movie.</p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t the man on the porch.</p><p>Casey took a breath. This was ridiculous! Jack Worth was a common name. Kit couldn&#x2019;t have been referring to the actor.</p><p>On impulse, she tapped the other name, Tatton Landers, into her phone&#x2019;s search engine, and it redirected her. There he was. The man she&#x2019;d watched showering on her porch had thousands of photos on the Internet. Most of them were in period costume: a knight in armor, tight Regency trousers, a leather jerkin like Robin Hood would wear.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she said aloud. &#x201c;Tate Landers.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d never seen one of his movies, but a friend of hers used to talk about him. She loved romantic movies and went to all of them. They&#x2019;d never interested Casey so she&#x2019;d only half-listened to what her friend was saying&#x2014;and had teased her friend about them.&#x201c; You have a Ph.D. in psychology but you drool over some actor who says, &#x2018;Oh, Charity Goodheart, your eyes are like emeralds. Please be mine.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t get it, do you?&#x201d; her friend said.&#x201c; We live in a world of metrosexuals. Tate isn&#x2019;t like that. He throws women over the saddle of a horse and tells them to shut up.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey was aghast. &#x201c;What would you say to one of your clients if she told you her boyfriend did that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d give her the number of a center for abused women and make sure she went. But that&#x2019;s real; Tate is fantasy.&#x201d;</p><p>Casey shook her head at her friend. &#x201c;This guy is an actor. In real life he probably wears pink shirts and gets his eyebrows waxed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not Tate! I read that he&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Casey had thrown up her hands. Her friend had tried to get her to go to romantic movies, but she wouldn&#x2019;t. With her workload she had little time off and she wasn&#x2019;t going to waste it on some drippy saga.</p><p>Now it seemed that she was living in a house on property owned by some big-deal movie star&#x2014;who hated her.</p><p>And rightfully so, Casey thought. It was one thing to watch some half-naked guy mow the lawn, but when people spied on public figures they often ended up in court. And went to prison.</p><p>What was it he&#x2019;d said? &#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d; And &#x201c;Please tell me you didn&#x2019;t use&nbsp;<i>this</i>! I think I deserve better than a mobile phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He thought I was photographing him,&#x201d; she said aloud. When he thought she&#x2019;d snapped the pictures on a cellphone, his ego had been hurt. In spite of the gravity of the situation, she couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. No wonder he ran away at the mention of the sheriff. Wouldn&#x2019;t the tabloids love a photo of the romantic hero in handcuffs?</p><p>Casey stood up.&#x201c; I have to fix this,&#x201d; she whispered. She needed to apologize and explain, then apologize some more.</p><p>She looked at the clock on the mantel. It was still early, so she could take about an hour to do what she did best. She was going to cook something wonderful and take it to him. She&#x2019;d use her best I&#x2019;m-sorry voice to make him forgive her. And she&#x2019;d assure him that she had entered the room just as the phone rang, so she&#x2019;d only seen him with his shirt off.</p><p>That&#x2019;s good, she thought. A few lies, some of her honey-glazed chicken, and a good strong mimosa, and maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t kick her out of her very comfortable little house. Or put her in jail.</p><p>She had a plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>ACT ONE, SCENE TWO</b></p><p><b>Elizabeth doesn&#x2019;t tempt Darcy</b></p><p>An hour later, Casey arrived at the Big House&#x2014;as everyone in town referred to it&#x2014;with food. She&#x2019;d used some of what she&#x2019;d already prepared for Kit&#x2019;s group, then added a few things. In an insulated container she had strands of slow-roasted, honey-glazed chicken and sweet-potato hash with fried eggs on top. She&#x2019;d buttered freshly made bread and grilled it.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t easy to think about what she had to do.

Mitchell and his shipmates have to keep their own damaged boat afloat, figure out a way to make the Russians listen, and keep the trapped Russian submariners alive until they can be saved - if that is even possible.</p><p><b>This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.</b></p></p><p><p><b>Larry Bond</b> is the author of several bestselling military thrillers, including <i>Crash Dive</i>, <i>Dangerous Ground</i>, <i>Red Phoenix</i> and the Larry Bond's First Team and Larry Bond's Red Dragon Rising series.

Seawolf was one of the biggest attack submarines in the U.S. Navy, but the ops department was just barely able to squeeze everyone in. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When Jerry called out his name, Gibson stepped up smartly and took the clipboard. IT2 Paul Gibson had been aboard the boat longer than Jerry. He was a little on the pudgy side, a common problem on subs where great food and few opportunities for exercise left their mark. He was twenty-seven, with a wife and a one- year- old son. He took position in front of the assembled sailors and began reading the plan of the day. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"Our underway is now in eight days. Supply chits have to be turned in by tomorrow if Mr. Constantino is supposed to fill them..." </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jerry already knew what the PoD said, and Gibson had everything under control. As he stood, half- listening, Jerry looked over the operations department&#x2014;his department. That still sounded strange, even after six months on board. Ops department was eighteen men, including Jerry and Lieutenant Chandler. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As the commo, Chandler was in charge of six "information systems technicians,"or "ITs,"although most of the crew still called them radiomen. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>And he was responsible for all the boat&#x2019;s communications equipment and encryption gear. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>And as operations officer, Jerry was responsible for everyone in the department, including Chandler. Jerry was also Seawolf&#x2019;s navigator, in direct charge of the four quartermasters and six electronics technicians who ran the boat&#x2019;s navigation systems. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>His sailors were neatly lined up in three groups, wearing clean working uniforms. Civilians would be impressed by their military bearing and discipline. But Jerry knew he faced a band of rugged individualists who worked together only by choice. And while they worked together well, that didn&#x2019;t come automatically, or even easily. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"Family day is Saturday, with a cookout at the ball field. We&#x2019;re still looking for some people to help with the kids&#x2019; games, so contact MM2 Stone if you&#x2019;re interested. The ship&#x2019;s ombudsman and the family support network still need email addresses..." </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jerry&#x2019;s mind wandered to his own personal "to do"list. However, since he was navigator, operations officer, and senior watch officer, technically it was "lists."Oh. And he was one of three qualified divers on board. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As he mentally went down his tally, he looked down at his watch to check the time. No sweat, he still had fifteen minutes before his meeting with Lieutenant Commander Shimko, the executive officer. He had to go over the voyage plan&#x2014;again. The crew wouldn&#x2019;t be briefed about their destination until they were under way, but Jerry not only knew where they were going, he had planned out their entire trip in detail. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It was to Seawolf&#x2019;s benefit that the XO was a detail freak, but it didn&#x2019;t make Jerry&#x2019;s life any easier. He was pretty sure he&#x2019;d dreamed about the north Barents Sea again last night. He&#x2019;d been cold when he woke up. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Gibson finished reading the PoD and looked expectantly at Jerry. Sensing his cue, Mitchell stepped forward and asked, "Do the chiefs or leading petty officers have anything further to add?"All four men responded in the negative. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"All right, then. Turn to and commence ship&#x2019;s work. Dismissed."As the members of the department queued up to exit through the narrow door into the control room, Jerry saw QM1 Peters waiting for his turn, and caught the quartermaster&#x2019;s eye. He pointed to his watch and then held up five fingers. Peters nodded, understanding. The ship&#x2019;s leading quartermaster would be at the briefing with the XO as well. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jerry waited patiently to exit the nav equipment space and quickly headed aft to his stateroom. Even though the wardroom was on the same deck, and near his quarters, he&#x2019;d have to hurry a little if he wanted to be punctual. To save time, he&#x2019;d already organized the materials he needed to bring the night before, but as he approached his stateroom he saw Lieutenant Chandler waiting with a sheaf of papers in his hand and an earnest expression on his face. "Jerry, here are the last of our school requests, but I need to ask you a few questions..." </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jerry cut him off as he stepped into his stateroom. "Sorry, Matt. I&#x2019;m wearing my navigator hat right now. I&#x2019;ve got a voyage planning review in the wardroom with the XO."He dialed his safe and began removing his notes. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"I know, but this will only take a moment, and I have to turn them in this morning,"the comms officer pleaded. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"It&#x2019;ll be morning for some time yet, and I do not want to keep the XO waiting."Closing the safe should have added a note of finality to Jerry&#x2019;s statement. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Chandler wouldn&#x2019;t give up. "I&#x2019;ll just turn them in as is. They&#x2019;re probably fine." </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"Not without me seeing them first,"Jerry insisted. That was standard procedure for any paperwork going up the chain of command. And Chandler knew better. When the commo smiled and started to offer Jerry the documents, Jerry repeated, "After the meeting. Find me then,"he said firmly, letting some irritation show. Jerry didn&#x2019;t like mind games. Chandler seemed to think it was the only way to get things done. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hurrying the few steps to the wardroom, Jerry entered and found QM1 Peters already inside, laying out the charts. Jerry checked them over one last time, carefully comparing them to his own notes. Only after everything appeared in order did he allow himself to get a cup of coffee. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ETC Hudson and Lieutenant Commander Shimko appeared in the door as Jerry was pouring. He offered a cup to the XO, who gratefully accepted one. Peters also had some, but Hudson declined. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Marcus Shimko was second-generation American, born to Andrei and Natalia six years after they&#x2019;d emigrated from what was then the Soviet Union and now Belarus. He was short, about Jerry&#x2019;s height, but stocky where Jerry was slim. Shimko had already lost a lot of his hair, but what was left was sandy and cut very short. He was all business, an exceptional organizer and a detail hound&#x2014;the perfect executive officer. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jerry teased Hudson about "not stooping to drink wardroom coffee"but kept one eye on the XO. When the executive officer sat down, ship&#x2019;s business took over. Jerry picked up his notes while Hudson double-checked the wardroom door, making sure it was locked. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>With his laser pointer, Jerry highlighted individual sections of the entire mission on the nautical chart taped to the table. The bright blue and yellow chart was overlaid with black lines showing Seawolf&#x2019;s plotted course, and red Top Secret labels rubber-stamped on each corner. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>"Our projected track takes us out of the Block Island Sound, east, and then northeast. I&#x2019;ve recommended passing to the west of Iceland, using the Denmark Strait. Once past Iceland, we follow the east coast of Greenland, using shallow water and biologics wherever possible to mask our approach. Assuming an on- time departure on the fifteenth and a speed of advance of sixteen knots, we should arrive at Point Alpha at 1200 Zulu time on the twenty- third."Jerry pointed to the first of a series of x&#x2019;s on the chart. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>He&#x2019;d rehearsed the speech several times, and gotten it off smoothly</p></p><h2>Elizabeth Alston&#39;s Best Baking: 80 Recipes for Angel Food Cakes, Chiffon Cakes, Coffee Cakes, Pound Cakes, Tea Breads, and Their Accompaniments</h2><p>Indulge your sweet tooth with eighty of Elizabeth Alston's most beloved and delicious baking recipes.

On 10 April 1938 Ki-27 pilots of the 2nd Daitai (later to become the 64th Sentai) claimed 24 Chinese biplane fighters shot down for the loss of only two of their own. Almost within a year of its combat debut against the Chinese the 97 Sen was to be tested in fighting against the Russians during the Nomonhan Incident of 1939. Initially the 97 Sen proved superior to the Soviet I-16 monoplanes, but the latter were hastily modified to better engage the Japanese fighter and the Russian pilots rapidly adapted to exploit their own strengths and the enemy weaknesses. A handful of Japanese Army Air Force (JAAF) aces emerged from this showdown to be lauded by the Japanese press and ever associated with the iconic 97 Sen - Shimada the &#39;Red-Legged Hawk&#39;, Shihonara the &#39;Richthofen of the Orient&#39; and Yoshiyama, the &#39;warrior of the Holombile Plateau&#39;. These were the glory days for the JAAF and many of the successful 97 Sen pilots went on to become the outstanding leaders and veteran aces of the Pacific War. By December, 1941 the JAAF had just started to replace the 97 Sen with the more modern Hayabusa, but the fixed undercarriage fighter still equipped 17 of the 19 Army fighter Sentai and took the brunt of the offensive against the British and Americans in Southeast Asia and the Philippines, as well as the Homeland Defence capability at the time of the Doolittle Raid. Initially facing more modern Allied types of fighter, the 97 Sen was more than able to hold its own by exploiting its outstanding aerobatic qualities. But the writing was on the wall for an unarmoured, fixed undercarriage aircraft with two rifle-calibre machine guns as the Allies consolidated and began their fightback. In China, Chennault had already assessed the 97 Sen&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, describing it as a fighter that &#39;climbs like a sky rocket and manoeuvres like a squirrel&#39;. Prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War he had sent a complete dossier on the type to the USA where it was studiously ignored. The pace of re-equipment with new types and the resurgence of Allied airpower required JAAF units to continue with the 97 Sen as main equipment, especially on the quieter fronts and in Home Defence. By 1943 it was considered seriously obsolete but was still being encountered in combat by Allied pilots, especially in the air defence role. The Ki-27 also found an important secondary role as an armed fighter trainer, equipping an important number of training units and flying schools. The Mansyu Ki-79, a purpose built trainer produced in both single and two-seater versions, was based on the Ki-27. It also served expediently in the suicide attack role and in at least one epic air defence combat. In February 1945, over Chiba, experienced ace WO Masatoshi Masuzawa, flying one of the open cockpit trainers, downed a US Navt Hellcat. Masuzawa had scored his first victory in a 97 Sen over Nomonhan in 1939, and in three months of fighting there had claimed 12 enemy aircraft shot down. He epitomised the veteran JAAF flyers who had first taken the 97 Sen to war and survived to see the atom bombs dropped on their homeland.</p><p>Nicholas Millman is one of Britain&#39;s leading researchers of Japanese military aviation.

Brought to power as a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688-9 which deposed Mary's father - the Catholic King James II - their reign was a crucial period during which new restrictions of royal power helped to lay the foundations of modern constitutional monarchy. In this first biography of the two monarchs for over thirty years, John Van der Kiste provides a lively and accessible account of their lives and times.<p>William, one of the leading Protestant champions of Europe, and Mary, his young cousin and wife, reigned jointly for only five years. In 1694 Mary died from smallpox and William ruled alone for another eight years. Although short, their reign was notable for the inauguration of the Declaration of Rights and triennial elections, both of which limited the sovereign's power and reaffirmed parliament's. In warfare, however, it was another matter: although William was the first monarch who was not granted an independent income, he was also one of the last to lead his armies in person. He involved England decisively in European affairs and created a new balance of power on the continent. During William's absences at war, Mary was regent. Although she had wept when first told, aged fifteen, that she was to marry her unprepossessing and charmless cousin, they developed a close and loving relationship. Popular with the nation, a connoisseur of architecture, music and gardens, she encouraged the work of Henry Purcell and persuaded William to buy Kensington House, which was rebuilt by Wren and later became one of the major royal residences.</p><p>This new biography not only recounts William and Mary's lives and reign but also explores their political influence, the troubled relationships with Mary's father, with her sister - and husband's successor - Anne, and with Charles II's illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth who mounted an unsuccessful challenge to the throne. It will be essential reading for all those interested in Stuart history and in the development of the monarchy.</p></p><p>John Van der Kiste has written nearly 20 books on British and European royalty. His most recent biography, with Coryne Hall, is Xenia: Sister of Nicholas II (June 2002)His other works include Kaiser Wilhelm: Germany&#39;s Last Emperor and Georgian Princesses. He also writes historical articles and reviews for local and national journals, and contributed to the New Dictionary of National Biography.</p><h2>Heaven</h2><p>From the bestselling author of &#39;Flowers in the Attic&#39; comes the first book in the series centred around the Casteel family and its dark and mysterious past. Repackaged to attract a new generation of Andrews&#39; fans HER NAME WAS HEAVEN, HER LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT Heaven&#39;s mother Angel had died in childbirth, and from that moment her father turned against her. Her only allies, it seemed, were her four half-brothers and sisters. When their father, poor and desperate, sold them to strangers, Heaven was left alone and friendless. Her only hope was to reunite her family. But how? So begins the heartbreaking, magical story of the Casteel family, continued in &#39;Dark Angel&#39;, &#39;Fallen Hearts&#39;, &#39;Gates of Paradise&#39; and &#39;Web of Dreams&#39;.</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Prologue</b><br><br>Whenever the summer winds blow I hear the flowers whispering, and the leaves singing in the forest, and I see again the birds on wing, the river fish jumping. I remember, too, the winters; how the bare tree branches made tortured sounds as the cold winds whipped them about, forcing limbs to scrape the shedlike cabin that clung precariously to the steep mountainside of a range called by the West Virginian natives, the Willies.<br><br>The wind didn't just blow in the Willies, it howled and shrieked, so everyone living in the Willies had good reason for looking anxiously out their small dirty windows. Living on the mountainsides was enough to give anyone the willies -- especially when the wolves howled like the wind and the bobcats screeched and the wild things of the forests roamed at will. Often small pets would vanish, and once every decade or so an infant disappeared or a toddler wandered off and was never seen again.<br><br>With special clarity I remember one particular cold February night that revealed to me my own beginning. It was the eve of my tenth birthday. I lay close to the wood stove on my floor pallet, tossing and turning, hearing the wolves yowl at the moon. I had the unfortunate habit of sleeping lightly, so the slightest movement in the tiny cabin jolted me awake. Every sound was magnified in our isolated cabin. Granny and Grandpa snored. Pa staggered home drunk, bumping into furniture as he stumbled over sleeping bodies on the floor before he crashed down on the squealing springs of his big brass bed, waking up Ma and making her angry again so she raised her voice in shrill complaint because again he'd spent too much time in Winnerrow, in <i>Shirley's Place.</i> At that time I didn't even know why <i>Shirley's Place</i> was such a bad place, and why Pa's going there caused so much trouble.<br><br>Our cabin floor, with half-inch spacings between each crookedly laid board, let in not only cold air but also the snortings of the sleeping pigs, dogs, cats, and whatever else took retreat under it.<br><br>Out of the black suddenly came a different kind of noise. Who was moving in the darkness of the dim red glow near the stove? I strained to see it was Granny, bent over, her long gray hair streaming, making her seem a witch sliding along the rough wooden planks as quietly as possible. It couldn't be the outhouse she was heading for; Granny was the only one of us allowed to use the "hockeypot" when nature called. The rest of us had to trek two hundred yards to the outhouse. Granny was in her mid-fifties. Chronic arthritis and various other undiagnosed aches and pains made life miserable for Granny, and the loss of most of her teeth made her seem twice her age. Once, so I had been told by those old enough to remember, Annie Brandywine had been the beauty queen of the hills.<br><br>"Come, girl," Granny whispered hoarsely, her gnarled hand on my shoulder, "it's time ya stopped cryin out in t'night. I'm hopin maybe ya won't be doin it no more once ya know t'truth bout yerself. So, before yer pa wakes up agin, ya an <i>me</i> are goin somewheres, an fore we come back, ya'll have somethin t'cling ta when he glares his eyes an slings his fists." She sighed like the south wind blowing gently, whispering the tendrils of hair around my face to make them tickle like ghosts that were coming -- through her.<br><br>"You mean we're going outside? Granny, it's miserably cold out there," I warned even as I got up and pulled on a cast-off pair of Tom's too-big shoes. "You aren't planning on going far, are you?"<br><br>"Gotta," said Granny. "Hurts bad t'hear t'words my Luke yells at his own firstborn. Even worse, it makes my blood run cold t'hear ya scream right back when he can strike out an end what ain't hardly begun yet. Girl, why do ya have t'answer back?"<br><br>"You know, you know," I whispered. "Pa hates me, Granny, and I don't know why. Why does he hate me so much?"<br><br>There was enough moonlight coming through a window to allow me to see her dear old wrinkled face.<br><br>"Yes, yes, time ya knew," she mumbled, tossing me a heavy black shawl she'd knitted herself, then wrapping her own narrow, bent shoulders in another just as dark and drab. She led me to the door, swung it open, letting in the cold wind before she shut it again. In their bed beyond the tattered faded red curtain, Ma and Pa grumbled as if the wind half woke them. "We got a trip t'make, ya an me, down t'where we plant our kinfolk. Been atryin t'make it with ya fer many a year. Kin't keep puttin it off. Time runs out, it does. Then it's too late."<br><br>So on this cold, snowy, miserable, dark night she and I set off through the black piny woods. A solid sheet of ice lay rippling on the river, and the wolves sounded closer now. "Yep, Annie Brandywine Casteel sure knows how t'keep secrets," Granny said as if to herself. "Not many do, ya know, not many born like me...ya listenin, girl, are ya?"<br><br>"Can't help but hear you, Granny. You're shouting directly in my ear."<br><br>She had me by the hand, leading me a far way from home. Crazy to be out here, it was. Why, on this freezing winter's night, was she going to give up one of her precious secrets, and to me? Why me? But I loved her enough to assist her down the rough mountain trail. It seemed like miles we traveled in the dark cold of night, that old moon overhead shining down on us with evil intentions.<br><br>The treat she had in store for me was a graveyard, stark and eerie in the light of the pale bluish winter moon. The wind blew wild and fierce and snapped her thin white hair and blended it with my own before she spoke again. "Onliest thin I kin give ya, child, onliest thin worth havin, is what I'm gonna tell ya."<br><br>"Couldn't you have told me in the cabin?"<br><br>"Nah," she scoffed, stubborn as she could sometimes be, set in her ways like an old tree with too many roots. "Ya wouldn't pay no tention iffen I told ya there. <i>Here,</i> ya'll always rememba."<br><br>She hesitated as her eyes fixed on a slim little tombstone. She raised her arm and pointed her gnarled finger at the granite headstone. I stared at it and tried to read what was engraved there. How very odd for Granny to bring me here during the night, where maybe the ghosts of those who lay here roamed about looking for living bodies to inhabit.<br><br>"Ya gotta fergive yer pa fer bein what he is," intoned Granny, huddling close to me for warmth. "He's what he is, and he kin't help it no more than t'sun kin help from risin or settin, no more than t'skunks kin help from makin their stinks, an no more than ya kin help bein what ya are."<br><br>Oh, that was an easy thing for Granny to say. Old people didn't remember what it was like to be young and afraid.<br><br>"Let's go home," I said, shivering and pulling at Granny. "I've heard and read tales about what goes on in graveyards on nights when the moon is full and the hour is after midnight."<br><br>"Know betta than to be skerred of dead thins that kin't move or speak."<br><br>Yet she drew me tighter into her embrace and forced me to stare again at the narrow sunken grave. "Ya jus listen an don't say nothin till I'm finished. I got a tale t'tell that's gonna make ya feel betta. There's a good reason why yer pa speaks mean when he looks at ya. He don't really hate ya. In my mind I done put t'pieces togetha, an when my Luke looks at ya he sees <i>not</i> ya but someone else...an, chile, he really is a lovin man. A good man underneath it all. Why, he had a first wife he loved so much he near died when she did. He met her down in Atlanta. He was seventeen an she was only fourteen an three days, so she tole me lata," Her thin voice dropped an octave. "Beautiful as an angel, she was, an oh, yer pa did love her so. Why, he swept her offen her feet, when she was runnin away from home. Headin fer Texas, she was. Runnin from Boston. Had a fancy suitcase with her, full of clothes t'likes of what ya've neva seen. All kinds of pretty stuff in that suitcase, suits an silky thins, silvery brush, comb an a silver mirror, an rings fer her fingas, an jewels fer her ears, an she come here t'live, cause she went an made t'mistake of marryin up with a man not her kind...cause she loved him."<br><br>"Granny, I've never heard of Pa having a first wife. I thought Ma was his first and only wife."<br><br>"Didn't I tell ya t'stay quiet? Ya let me finish tellin this in my own way...She was from a rich Boston family. Come t'live with Luke an Toby an me. I didn't want her when she come. Didn't like her at first. Knew she wouldn't last, right from t'first, knew that. Too good fer t'likes of us, an t'hills, an t'hardships. Thought we had bathrooms, she did. Shocked her when she knew she'd have t'trek ta t'outhouse, an sit on a board with two holes. Then durn if Luke didn't go an build her a pretty lil outhouse all her own, painted it white, he did, an she put in it fancy rolled paper on a spindle, an even offered t'let me use her pink store-bought paper. Her <i>bathroom,</i> she called it. She hugged an kissed Luke fer doin that fer her."<br><br>"You mean Pa wasn't mean to her like he is to Ma?"<br><br>"Shut up, girt. Yer makin me lose track...She came, she stole my heart, maybe Toby's, too. She tried so hard t'do her best. Helpin out with t'cookin. Tryin t'make our cabin pretty. An Toby an me, we gave em our bed, so they could start their babies in t'right way an not on t'floor. She'd have slept on t'floor, she woulda, but wouldn't let her. All Casteels are made in beds...I'm ahopin an prayin anyways that's true. Well...one day she's laughin an happy cause she's gonna have a baby. My Luke's baby. An I feel so sorry, so blessed sorry. Was always ahopin she'd go back t'where she come from fore t'hills took her, t'way they do delicate folks. But she made him happy when she was here. Made him happier than he's been since." Granny stopped talking abruptly.<br><br>"How did she die, Granny? Is this her grave?"<br><br>She sighed before she continued. "Yer pa was only eighteen when she passed on, an she was still only fourteen when he had t'bury her in this cold ground an walk away an leave her alone in t'night. He knew she hated t'cold nights without him. Why, chile, he laid on her grave all t'first night t'keep her warm, an it was February...an that's my tale of her who came as an angel t'the hills, t'live an love yer pa, an make happier than he's eva been, an likely he'll neva be that happy agin, from t'looks of it."<br><br>"But why did you have to bring me out here to tell me all of this, Granny? You could have told me in the cabin. Even if it is a sad and kind of a sweet story...still, Pa's meaner than hell, and she must have taken all the best of him into the grave with her, and left only the worst for the rest of us. Why didn't she teach him how to love others? Granny, I wish she'd never come! Not ever come! Then Pa would love Ma, and he'd love me, and not her so much."<br><br>"Oh," said Granny, appearing stunned. "What's wrong with ya, girl, what's wrong? Ain't ya done guessed? That girl that yer pa called his angel, she was <i>yer ma!</i> She's the one who birthed ya, an by t'time ya come, she could hardly speak...an she named ya Heaven Leigh, she did. An ya kin't truly say, kin ya, that ya ain't proud of that name that everybody says suits ya jus fine, jus fine."<br><br>I forgot the wind. I forgot my hair snapping around my face. Forgot everything in the wonder of finding out just what and who I was.<br><br>When the moon slipped from behind a dark cloud, a random beam of light shone for an instant on the engraved name:<br><br><i>Angel<br><br>Beloved wife of Thomas Luke Casteel</i><br><br>Strange how it made me feel to see that grave. "But where did Pa find Sarah? And how did he do it so quick?"<br><br>Granny, as if eager to spill it all out while she had the chance, began to talk faster. "Well, yer pa needed a wife t'fill his empty bed. He hated his lonely nights, an men gets cravins, chile, <i>physical</i> cravins yer gonna find out bout one day when yer old enough. He wanted a wife t'give him what his angel had, an she tried, give Sarah credit fer that. She made ya a good motha, treated ya like ya were her own. Nursed ya, loved ya. An Sarah gave Luke her body willingly enough, but she had nothin of his angel's spirit t'give him, an that leaves him still yearnin fer t'girl who would have made him a betta man. He <i>was</i> betta then, chile Heaven -- even if ya don't believe it. Why, in t'days when yer angel ma were alive he'd set out fer work early each mornin, drivin his old pickup truck down t'Winnerrow where he was learnin all about carpentry an how t'build houses an such. He used t'come home full of nice talk about buildin us all a new house down in t'valley, an when he had that house, he were gonna work t'land, raise cows, pigs, an horses...yer pa, he's always had a keenin fer animals. Loves em, he does, like ya do, chile Heaven. Ya get that from him."<br><br>Odd how I felt when Granny took me back to the cabin, and from beneath a clutter of old junk, and many old cartons in which we kept our pitifully few clothes, she dragged out something wrapped about in an old quilt. From that she extracted an elegant suitcase, the kind mountain folks like us could never afford. "Yers," she whispered so the others wouldn't wake up and intrude on this most private moment. "Belonged t'yer ma. Promised her I'd give it t'ya when t'time were right. Figure it's as right as it'll eva be t'night, now...so look, girl, look. See what kind of ma ya had."<br><br>As if a dead mother could be compressed and put into a fancy, expensive suitcase!<br><br>But when I looked, I gasped.<br><br>There before me in the dim firelit room were the most beautiful clothes I'd ever seen. Such delicate lacy things I hadn't dreamed existed...and at the very bottom I found something long, and carefully wrapped in dozens of sheets of tissue paper. I could tell from Granny's expression she was tense, watching me closely, as if to savor my reaction.<br><br>In the dim glow of the woodfire burning I stared at a doll. A doll? What I'd expected least to find. I gazed and gazed at the doll with the silvery-gold hair bound up in a fancy way. She wore a wedding veil, the filmy mist flowing out from a tiny jeweled cap. Her face was exceptionally pretty, with beautifully shaped bowed lips, the upper cleft ridge fitting so precisely into the bottom center indentation. Her long dress was made of white lace, lavishly embroidered with tiny pearls and sparkling beads. A bride doll...veil and everything. Even her white shoes were lace and white satin, with sheer stockings fastened to a tiny garter belt, as I saw when I took a peak under the skirts and veil.<br><br>"It's her. Yer ma. Luke's angel that was named Leigh," whispered Granny, "jus t'way yer ma looked when she came here afta she married up with yer pa. Last thin she said before she died was, 'Give what I brought with me to my little girl...'An now I have."<br><br>Yes, now she had.<br><br>And in so doing, she'd changed the course of my life.<br><br><b>Chapter 1:The Way It Used To Be</b><br><br>If Jesus died almost two thousand years ago to save us all from the worst we had in us, he'd failed in our area, except on Sundays between the hours of ten A.M. and noon. At least in my opinion.<br><br>But what was my opinion? Worthy as onion peelings, I thought, as I pondered how Pa had married Sarah two months after my mother died in childbirth -- and he'd loved his "angel" so much. And four months after I was born and my mother was buried, Sarah gave birth to the son Pa had so wanted when I came along and ended my mother's brief stay on earth.<br><br>I was too young to remember the birth of this first son, who was christened Thomas Luke Casteel the Second, and they put him, so I've been told, in the cradle with me, and like twins we were rocked, nursed, held, but ...</p><h2>FIREFIGHTER&#39;S HDBK.ON WILDLAND FIRE...</h2><p>The NEW 4th Edition of this bestselling book by noted wildland firefighting author, Bill Teie is updated to address the most current NFPA and National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) standards and qualifications for wildland firefighting.

It seems probable that, within the warm saltiness of the primeval sea, certain organic substances were fashioned from carbon dioxide, sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium. Perhaps these were transition steps from which the complex molecules of protoplasm arose-molecules that somehow acquired the ability to reproduce themselves and begin the endless stream of life. It is doubtful that the first life possessed the substance chlorophyll, with which plants in sunlight transform lifeless chemicals into the living stuff of their tissues. Little sunshine could enter their dim world, penetrating the cloud banks from which fell the endless rains. Probably the sea&#39;s first children lived on the organic substances then present in the ocean waters, or, like the iron and sulphur bacteria that exist today, lived directly on inorganic food.</p><h2>Bottlemania: Big Business, Local Springs, and the Battle over America&#39;s Drinking Water</h2><p><p>Second only to soda, bottled water is on the verge of becoming the most popular beverage in the country. The brands have become so ubiquitous that we're hardly conscious that Poland Spring and Evian were once real springs, bubbling in remote corners of Maine and France. Only now, with the water industry trading in the billions of dollars, have we begun to question what it is we're drinking. </p><p>In this intelligent, accomplished work of narrative journalism, Elizabeth Royte does for water what Michael Pollan did for food: she finds the people, machines, economies, and cultural trends that bring it from distant aquifers to our supermarkets. Along the way, she investigates the questions we must inevitably answer. Who owns our water? How much should we drink? Should we have to pay for it? Is tap safe water safe to drink? And if so, how many chemicals are dumped in to make it potable? What happens to all those plastic bottles we carry around as predictably as cell phones? And of course, what's better: tap water or bottled?</p></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Royte</b> has written for the New York Times Magazine, Harper's, National Geographic, Outside, Smithsonian, and The New Yorker.

Our trip begins in 1953 at 148 Waverly Place, where new college graduate Cantwell lives in a dilapidated town house and launches her career in publishing as a secretary at Mademoiselle. We witness Cantwell's blossoming relationship with her bohemian, Jewish future husband, identified here only as B., and the terrors that bear down on her from her Irish-Catholic upbringing, such as the mortal-sin guilt she felt at the prospect of using a diaphragm. The only home she ever had outside the Village was 301 East 21st Street, where Cantwell's married life got off to a stumbling start, her dislike of sex became apparent and her migraines began. The couple moved to 224 West 11th Street, where B. started a successful publishing career. The couple's next flat was at 21 Perry Street, where B.'s "certainties fed my nothingness," but soon, Cantwell writes, she became pregnant and "God loved me." She writes wonderful pages on pregnancy and the birth of her daughter Katherine. She speaks of her fear of injuring the baby and admits "that once upon a time I was crazy." But with Katherine's birth, Cantwell found that "sex was okay now, because now I knew what it was for." And with the arrival of their second child, Margaret, there was the move to 44 Jane Street. Here Cantwell's career at Mademoiselle took off and her husband started to have affairs. Sickness in her daughters was traced to her husband's genes, and she knew she had "married a killer." The heart-wrenching disintegration of the marriage began: the silences, the threats and the anticlimactic divorce, out of which a new woman was born. With this paean to Village life and the maturation of her own self, Cantwell (American Girl) has written such an intimate book that the reader will feel like a joyful voyeur peeking into the window of her life. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lives of Girls and Women</h2><p>The story of Del Jordan growing up in gossipy and insular Jubilee begins with a frog-catching expedition and ends with a shattered love affair. Between, lies the rich and unforgettable texture of female experience.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesThe only novel from Alice Munro-award-winning author of The Love of a Good Woman--is an insightful, honest book, "autobiographical in form but not in fact," that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940's. <br>Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. <br>Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.</p><h2>Season&#39;s Gleamings: The Art of the Aluminum Christmas Tree</h2><p>They glitter. They shimmer. They bask in the glow of gently rotating color wheels. They last forever. Aluminum Christmas trees are the most spectacular souvenirs of our most recent Christmas Past-the Christmases of the super-mom 1960s.Season's Gleamings is the first book to celebrate these magnificent trees. More than 45 stunning color photographs reveal the beauty and range of aluminum arbor, from red-foil tabletop models to majestic seven-footers. Photographers J. Shimon &amp; J. Lindemann have trained their camera on their own collection of vintage trees, capturing them complete with hi-fi's and highballs.Aluminum trees were born in 1959 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, once the "Aluminum Cookware Capitol of the World." Within a couple of years, shiny, foil-branched Christmas trees were being made by dozens of companies and selling in the millions. Elvis adorned Graceland's front yard with a row of lighted aluminum trees. Their most famous appearance was in A Charlie Brown Christmas, when Lucy ordered Charlie Brown to "get the biggest aluminum tree you can find."Today the trade in vintage aluminum trees is fierce, and these crisp, beautiful symbols of modern living are again brightening thousands of American holidays. Season's Gleamings is a reminder of how beautiful an aluminum tree can be and makes a perfect gift for lovers of Christmases both real and artificial.</p><p>John Shimon and Julie Lindemann have been photographing collaboratively since the mid-1980s. Their work has appeared in New York, The New York Times Magazine, and Fortune magazine, and in the books Wisconsin Then and Now: The Wisconsin Sesquicentennial Rephotography Project, Photography&#39;s Antiquarian Avant-Garde, and Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self. Shimon and Lindemann live in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and teach at the Art Institute of Chicago and Lawrence University.</p><h2>Book of Jonah, The</h2><p>Retells the Biblical story of the man who spent three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish. Includes historical material on Jonah&#39;s world.</p><p>On his arrival in the United States in 1952, PETER SPIER became one of this country's most popular and renowned illustrators. His books, acclaimed by critics and readers alike, have won numerous awards and honors:&nbsp;<i>Noah's Ark</i>&nbsp;won the Caldecott Medal and<i>&nbsp;The Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night&nbsp;</i>was a Caldecott Honor Book.&nbsp;<i>People</i>&nbsp;was awarded the Christopher Medal and was also nominated for an American Book Award and received the National Mass Media Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for "outstanding contributions to better human relations and the cause of brotherhood." Mr. Spier was born and educated in Amsterdam. Before coming to the United States he served in the Royal Dutch Navy. He illustrated over one hundred books, and his work can be found in museums and private collections across the country. In addition to illustrating and writing, Mr. Spier was an avid and celebrated builder of model ships. Peter Spier died in 2017, at the age of 89.Kindergarten-Grade 3 Unlike his Noah's Ark (Doubleday, 1977), Spier has included the text from the Bible along with his usual delightful illustrations. Noah's humanity is fully exposedhis fear, obedience, anger and acceptance. Each picture is a story in itself, busy, colorful and page-filling, but never intruding on the text. The glossy paper stock of the book makes the pictures more colorful and alive than they are in Noah's Ark . Some who accept the Bible literally may be bothered by Spier's statement that Nineveh was three days journey from where the fish vomited out Jonahboth the King James and the New American versions indicate instead that Nineveh was so large that it took three days to cross. The Book of Jonah is an excellent lap or read-to book, and will be of some interest to older middle-schoolers. Valuable historical material dealing with Nineveh, Joppa and Tarshish in Noah's time, including archaeological maps and findings and diagrams of the Phoenician ships of the day, is located on the back endpapers. Unfortunately the jacket flap covers some of this information. Despite its shortcomings, The Book of Jonah is a delightful addition to the collection, and libraries will want to own at least one copy. Warwick Hutton's illustrations in Jonah and the Great Fish (Atheneum, 1984) are more human and appealing, but the book ends with Jonah being spit out of the fish's mouth and does not have the historical information that Spier's version has.

Over 350 outstanding artistic and cultural treasures from the period have now been gathered together for the first time in a catalogue which celebrates these extraordinary achievements and the profound transformation of Anglo-Saxon England which they reflect. Intricately illuminated manuscripts, sophisticated metalwork and sculpture, documentary materials and the developing coinage are set firmly within the changing political and intellectual currents of the time, and the close relationship between Anglo-Saxon England and the Continent is examined. This book surveys the historical and cultural background to the art of the period and provides an authoritative, fully illustrated discussion of all the works included.</p><p></p><h2>The Greatest Works of Hal Lindsey: The Late Great Planet Earth/Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth</h2><p>A single volume includes The Late Great Planet Earth and Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth, and explores the prophecies of doom in the bible and overcoming evil forces in contemporary society.</p><p></p><h2>Doghouse Roses: Stories</h2><p>A debut collection of short fiction by the popular singer-songwriter features brutally honest, sometimes autobiographical tales, including the title story about a singer whose life has nearly been destroyed by drugs, &#34;Wheeler County&#34; about a hitchhiker stranded for years in a small Texas town, &#34;Billy the Kid,&#34; and more. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Fans of Steve Earle's music will recognize many familiar themes in his first collection of short stories, <i>Doghouse Roses</i>. Here are tales of drug addiction, the nightmare of Vietnam, and the price of failure (or success) in the music industry. Not surprisingly, the latter topic elicits some of Earle's best work: in "Billy the Kid," for example, he traces the meteoric rise of Nashville's last authentic country-music prodigy, whose early fame was abruptly terminated by a car accident. And in "Doghouse Roses," Bobby Charles's career nose-dives as he grapples with heroin, speedballs, and crack: "He suspended all pretence of taking care of himself, going for days without showering and living on a steady diet of ice cream and Dr. Pepper. He left the house only to cop, driving straight home and sitting in the tiny half bath in the hallway for hours with his pipe." Yet the protagonist, like his creator, finally regains a grip on sobriety, along with a revived career.<p> Earle misses the mark in "Taneytown," a first-person narrative told through the eyes of a mentally retarded black child. And his focus on the harsh (and very masculine) world of junkies, country music, and execution chambers can grow a little thin. Still, <i>Doghouse Roses</i> offers up an ample dose of optimism. After all, in a world where cold-blooded murderers let innocent men take the rap, and junkies watch their dealers die, the gods of forgiveness can still be summoned with a single rose sold at a convenience store--the age-old remedy for men in the proverbial doghouse. <i>--Gregory Bensinger</i></p>STEVE EARLE is a singer-songwriter who has released ten critically acclaimed albums since his 1986 debut album, Guitar Town, burst onto the Nashville scene and made him a star overnight. A prolonged struggle with drug addiction resulted in jail time in the early 1990s, but Earle&#x2019;s recovery and comeback albums, beginning wth the 1995 Grammy-nominated Train A Comin&#x2019;, have all been critical and commercial successes. His latest album is Transcendental Blues. Earle also works on behalf of a number of political causes, which have been the subjects of his songs for decades. In the struggle to end the death penalty, he serves as a board member of the Journey of Hope and is affiliated with both Citizens United for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (CUADP) and the Abolitionist Action Committee. He is also a supporter of the Campaign for a Landmine-Free World and the Kensington Welfare Rights Union.

From 1949 until his retirement in 1982 Guthrie was lecturer in New Testament studies at London Bible College, and from 1978 until 1982 he also served as vice principal of the college. His books include <em>New Testament Introduction, New Testament Theology</em>, and the <em>Tyndale New Testament Commentaries on the Pastoral Epistles and Hebrews</em>."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The evenness and quality of this series are remarkable." (Christianity Today)</p><h2>Chronicle of a Blood Merchant: A Novel</h2><p>A soaring literary achievement from internationally acclaimed writer Yu Hua, whose novels are now appearing in English for the first time, Chronicle of a Blood Merchant provides an unflinching portrait of China under Chairman Mao, as a factory worke must sell his blood to overcome every crisis.<br><br>Xu Sanguan is a Chinese everyman&#x2014;a cart-pusher in a silk mill struggling under the cruelty and hardships of Mao&#x2019;s leadership. His meager salary is not enough to sustain his family, so he pays regular visits to the local blood chief, followed by stops at the Victory Restaurant, where he pounds on the table and demands his ritual meal: &#x201c;A plate of fried pork livers and two shots of yellow rice wine. And warm the wine up for me.&#x201d;<br>But fried pork livers and yellow rice wine are not enough to restore Xu Sanguan. With the country in the throes of the Cultural Revolution, his visits to the blood chief become lethally frequent and his obligations to his family press against him mercilessly. At the height of famine, the Xu family lies motionless in bed, rising twice a day to consume increasingly watery rations of corn gruel. Xu Sanguan&#x2019;s wife is forced to stand on a stool in the center of town wearing a sandwich board that reads &#x201c;prostitute.&#x201d; Yile, his wife&#x2019;s bastard son, forever haunts Xu Sanguan&#x2019;s sense of honor. And when Xu Sanguan sells his blood so he can take his family out to a proper meal, he does not invite Yile, who paces the town, famished and in tears, offering himself as a son to any man who will buy him a bowl of noodles.<br><br>In a series of heartbreaking reversals, Xu Sanguan decides to risk his own life to save Yile and comes to understand that in a society ravaged by suspicion, hostility, and poverty, blood money not only pays debts, but forgives them as well. With rare emotional intensity, grippingly raw descriptions of place and time, and clear-eyed compassion, Yu Hua gives us a stunning tapestry of human life in the grave particulars of one man&#x2019;s days.</p><p>&#x201c;<b>Chronicle of a Blood Merchant</b><i> </i>takes us straight to the heartland of China&#x2013;the towns, streets, courtyards, kitchens, and bedrooms where ordinary Chinese live. They may not be great warriors or politicians, but their courageous efforts in living a life with hope and dignity make them true heroes. This book is a gem.&#x201d; &#x2013;Wang Ping, author of <b>Aching for Beauty</b><i><br></i><br>&#x201c;A major contemporary novelist, Yu Hua writes with a cold eye but a warm heart, and in a distinctive style that reveals his deep understanding of his subject&#x2013;the everyday people caught in a sinister web of history and traditions.

In <b>Chronicle of a Blood Merchant</b><i>, </i>he uses his uniquely contemporary and deceptively dispassionate tone, his expansive heart, and succinct, humanistic brushstrokes to convey a wrenching and blackly humorous tale. Long after I closed the book, the character Xu Sanguan has remained stubbornly impressed upon my heart.&#x201d; &#x2013;Dai Sijie, author of <b>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress<br></b><br>&#x201c;Yu Hua captures the simplicities and complexities of Chinese family life over many tumultuous decades. With great love coated in black humor, Yu Hua shows the great goodness and kindness that a father can draw upon even in the face of multiple hardships and the sometimes terrible depths to which he will go to save his family.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Lisa See, author of On Gold Mountain<b><br></b>Yu Hua was born in 1960 in Zhejiang, China. He finished high school during the Cultural Revolution and worked as a dentist for five years before beginning to write in 1983.

Newspapers and television programs detailed the brutal slayings of a beautiful actress--twenty six years old and eight months pregnant with her first child--as well as a hair stylist, an heiress, a businessman, and other victims. The City of Angels was plunged into a nightmare of fear and dread. In the weeks and months that followed, law enforcement faced intense pressure to solve crimes that seemed to have no connection.</p><p>Finally, after months of dead-ends, false leads, and near-misses, Charles Manson and members of his "family" were arrested. The bewildering trials that followed once again captured the nation and forever secured <em>Manson</em> as a byword for the evil that men do.</p><p>Drawing upon deep archival research and exclusive personal interviews--including unique access to Manson Family parole hearings--former federal prosecutor and Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl has written a propulsive, page-turning historical thriller of the crimes and manhunt that mesmerized the nation. And in the process, she reveals how the social and political context that gave rise to Manson is eerily similar to our own.</p></p><p><p>Lis Wiehl is the former legal analyst for Fox News and the <em>O&#x2019;Reilly Factor</em> and has appeared regularly on <em>Your World with Neil Cavuto</em>, <em>Lou Dobbs Tonight</em>, and the Imus morning shows.

Codevilla reveals how the true history of the Swiss in World War II has been buried beneath a modern campaign of moral blackmail that has accused Switzerland of secretly supporting Nazi Germany and sharing culpability for the Holocaust.</p><p>Realpolitik and Moral Blackmail <p>In Between the Alps and a Hard Place, Professor Angelo M. Codevilla reveals how the true history of the Swiss in World War II has been buried beneath a modern campaign of moral blackmail that has accused Switzerland of secretly supporting Nazi Germany and sharing culpability for the Holocaust. Codevilla&#x2014;who practiced real-life, hardball foreign policy as an intelligence adviser in the U.S. Senate&#x2014;offers a primer on the realities of power politics, using the Swiss experience in World War II to illuminate the workings of the balance of power, military deterrence, economic leverage, and subversion. </p><p>But more, he exposes how current American leaders are ignoring the realities of international affairs by putting domestic politics and political payoffs ahead of the national interest. </p><p>In the context of World War II, Codevilla shows how tiny Switzerland successfully fended off an Axis war machine thirty times its strength and simultaneously made itself available as a lifeboat to Jewish and other ethnic refugees. The Swiss recognized that military power is the foundation of international relations, and they deterred a Nazi invasion by keeping their country more valuable to the Germans as a free nation than as a conquered one. </p><p>Codevilla documents how the anti-Swiss campaign offered no evidence for its shocking claims but still managed to shake down two of the largest banks of a friendly power for $1.25 billion. The campaign set a terrible precedent, whereby a powerful domestic interest group&#x2014;and major donor to the Clinton-Gore administration&#x2014;harnessed the power of the U.S. government to grossly distort history and secure a financial windfall. In the process, the larger interests of the United States were subverted for the sake of a favorite domestic constituency of the ruling party. </p><p>Between the Alps and a Hard Place is both thrilling World War II history and an expos� of the shameful selling of historical truth and American foreign policy for political gain. </p><p>Angelo M. Codevilla is a professor of international relations at Boston University. He has been a U.S. Naval officer, a U.S. Foreign Service officer, a senior staff member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and a senior research fellow at Stanford University&#x2019;s Hoover Institution.

Moore and internationally acclaimed photographer Jane Lidz for decades. Their mutual interest has resulted in Water and Architecture, a collaboration of vibrant, poetic images and words in which the two reveal the expressive force of water, one of the most powerful and versatile of architectural elements.<br>In his lively, insightful text, Moore first addresses the symbolism of water as a design element, then examines the specific uses of water in a wide spectrum of architectural structures - fountains and waterfalls, rivers and canals, lakes and pools, and oceans and island - concluding with a look at basic design principles and environmental issues. Following each chapter are Lidz's spectacular color photographs - 130 in all - which bring the sites and ideas discussed vividly to life. The inspirational beauty of these images captures the essence of each design.<br>The scope of the book is impressive. The architecture ranges in style from classical to postmodern and includes places both celebrated and secret, from splendid palaces to humble plazas, waterfront skylines to private pools. Equally broad is the worldwide geographical span of the book: Bali, Belgium, China, England, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Spain, Thailand, and the United States are represented in Lidz's photographs.<br>The text sections are accompanied by black-and-white documentary illustrations and architectural plans. A comprehensive list of the color photographs and an index round out this magnificent volume, which speaks not only to architects and designers but also to lovers of art, photography, gardens, and travel - to anyone who has ever been enthralled by the mystical power of water.</p><p>The interplay of water and architecture--in waterfront skylines, ports, houses, fountains, canals, plazas, natural and artificial lakes and pools--is the theme of this exquisite album. Skimming from ocean-straddling temples in Bali and Rome's grandiose Trevi Fountain to cities like Paris and San Antonio that are inextricably linked to their rivers, architect Moore's limpid essay is at once a loving celebration of water as source and symbol of life, and a searching inquiry into how architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn manipulate water's physical characteristics and associations. Lidz's intuitive photographic vision seems perfectly attuned to this subject, and no one who ponders this globe-straddling photo-essay will look at water in quite the same way again.

But how valid is this outsider&#x2019;s view of Scandinavia, and how accurate our picture of life in Scandinavia today? Scandinavians follows a chronological progression across the Northern centuries: the Vendel era of Swedish prehistory; the age of the Vikings; the Christian conversions of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland; the unified Scandinavian state of the late Middle Ages; the sea-change of the Reformation; the kingdom of Denmark-Norway; King Gustav Adolphus and the age of Sweden&#x2019;s greatness; the cultural golden age of Ibsen, Strindberg and Munch; the impact of the Second World War; Scandinavia&#x2019;s postwar social democratic nirvana; and the terror attacks of Anders Behring Breivik. Scandinavians is also a personal investigation, with award-winning author Robert Ferguson as the ideal companion as he explores wide-ranging topics such as the power and mystique of Scandinavian women, from the Valkyries to the Vikings; from Nora and Hedda to Garbo and Bergman. This digressive technique is familiar from the writings of W. G.

Goodrich&#x2019;s Coverlet and Counterpane Drafts</h2><p>This collection of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century weaving drafts from the Southern Highlands region of Appalachia includes 112 overshot drafts and drawdowns, and 31 drafts and drawdowns for the all-white summertime cotton bedspreads called counterpanes. Color photos of the original samples are shown side by side with valuable modern translations of the drafts, which enable today's weavers to make them. A vibrant example of our weaving heritage, these drafts were originally gathered in the nine states of the Southern Highlands region between 1892 and 1918 by the legendary Frances L. Goodrich. Handwoven counterpanes and coverlets were important possessions, and often were the only items of beauty in the women's otherwise impoverished living conditions. These are drafts Goodrich carefully collected but did not include in her classic <em>Brown Book</em>. Dozens of vintage photographs of Goodrich, the communities she served, and the women who invented the drafts help bring this part of our American craft heritage to life.</p><p>Barbara Miller has been weaving for more than forty years, and has taught weaving for craft schools, guilds, and conferences.

This proliferation of the joy of haiku is cause for celebration&#x2014;but it can also compel us to go back to the beginning: to look at haiku&#x2019;s development during the centuries before it was known outside Japan. This in-depth study of haiku history begins with the great early masters of the form&#x2014;like Basho, Buson, and Issa&#x2014;and goes all the way to twentieth-century greats, like Santoka. It also focuses on an important aspect of traditional haiku that is less known in the West: haiku art. All the great haiku masters created paintings (called <i>haiga</i>) or calligraphy in connection with their poems, and the words and images were intended to be enjoyed together, enhancing each other, and each adding its own dimension to the reader&#x2019;s and viewer&#x2019;s understanding. Here one of the leading haiku scholars of the West takes us on a tour of haiku poetry&#x2019;s evolution, providing along the way a wealth of examples of the poetry and the art inspired by it.</p><p>Stephen Addiss, PhD, is Professor of Art at the University of Richmond in Virginia. A scholar-artist, he has exhibited his ink paintings and calligraphy in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

Parker lives with his family in Southern California.<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The camel spiders of Afghanistan were the size of his hand but they couldn&#x2019;t kill his strong young body. Neither could the little saw-scaled vipers that were almost invisible on the sand and crawled into his bedding at night. The heat of the summer fighting season couldn&#x2019;t kill him, and not the winter cold that barreled down the mountains, heavy as a freight train, straddling them where they slept or did not sleep, on the ground behind the Hesco blocks or on rooftops or hunkered ten to a room at base. The skinnies couldn&#x2019;t kill him with bombs hidden in the rocks or buried along the roads, nor with grenades launched from the hills or mortars fired from behind the ridgelines. Not with their AKs or sniper rifles or aged, wired-together long guns left over from other wars in another century. Not with knives or hatchets or sticks. Nothing could kill him, so Patrick Norris did the killing, until they sent him from Sangin back to San Diego in the fall, a free man, twenty-two years old, wounded on the inside only.</p> <p>He arrived at Lindbergh Field and when he walked into the terminal people set down their bags and clapped. He nodded once and slung his duffel over his shoulder and kept his eyes ahead.</p> <p>As he washed his hands in the restroom an older man at the next sink looked at him in the mirror. &#x201c;Afghanistan?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Headed home?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes. Fallbrook.&#x201d;</p> <p>The man passed a gnarled hand over the faucet sensor and the water sprayed out. &#x201c;I hear the fire was bad there. When the flames hit the groves. You can still see smoke in the north.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was in Korea, fifty-one and two.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe I should thank you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Now the South Koreans have a better health care system than we do. We&#x2019;re twenty-third in the world. It&#x2019;s all changed for the worse here. The country. The people. The government. Everything&#x2019;s gone bad.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what you hope.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe you don&#x2019;t know jack, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know it when I see it. Well, thanks again.&#x201d;</p> <p>Norris rode the outdoor escalator down, the sun at his back and warm on the desert camo, his duffel riding the step behind him. To the south stood the downtown high-rises, and yachts bobbed on a spangled bay. He thought of all the fish under that water. The colors dazzled him. He had not seen anything like this for more than a year and he felt the salty breeze on his face and held in a lungful of good American air. It smelled like heaven. Like safety, Patrick thought, finally. He counted blessings: arms and legs still attached, blood contained, brain working. He closed his eyes and thought of Myers and Zane, and they and the many other ghosts in his heart rose and hovered.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes his older brother, Ted, was standing down on the ground level, smiling up at him from where the steel steps of the escalator slid underground. They hugged and slapped each other&#x2019;s shoulders. Ted was tall and heavy; Patrick short and lean.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you came back home,&#x201d; said Ted.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where else would I go?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I mean not in a box!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I got lucky,&#x201d; said Patrick. A hundred times he could have died, he knew&#x2014;a thousand. You quit counting. God is luck.</p> <p>Ted slung his brother&#x2019;s duffel over his shoulder and they walked into the parking lot. It was hard for Ted to carry heavy things, having bad feet since birth, but Patrick let him. Two young women rolled their luggage past and Patrick and his brother looked at them but they didn&#x2019;t look back.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mom and Dad are cool that you didn&#x2019;t want them here to meet you,&#x201d; said Ted. &#x201c;They understand you need some peace and quiet. But just a warning&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve got the house all decorated up for you. We&#x2019;re lucky it survived the fire. Almost all eighty acres of our trees are gone, Pat.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I could have done something. Command got me here as soon as they could.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ted&#x2019;s pickup truck had a raised body and big tires, so the men sat up high. They rode the interstate north toward Fallbrook, which lay in the hills between two small rivers, fifteen miles from the Pacific. Far from town Patrick could see the pall in the sky and when they got closer the smell of fire hit him even through the air-conditioning. Along the frontage road a caravan of bulldozers and backhoes clanked back and forth from town. The air was as white as fog and the burned oaks hung like black skeletons within it.</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just now letting people come back,&#x201d; said Ted. &#x201c;It was mandatory to get out, Pat&#x2014;big government going house to house like gestapos, ordering us citizens from our homes. Dad cussed them out good and we stayed. We hosed down the house and outbuildings, and what we could of the trees. Then the water pressure ran out. It took the firemen a while to get here, because of all those other fires that started first. You know how avocado trees burn, like they got gas on them&#x2014;all that good oil. Dad had to let old Miguel go. <i>That</i> was not a happy moment. So now you can run the whole farm, like Dad always wanted.&#x201d;</p> <p>Patrick felt a chill steal over him. They wound into the hills. A creek bed ran alongside the road, and the oaks that grew there were now just shorn outlines of what they had been. Even with most of the hot spots extinguished days ago, the ground still reeked and smoked. Patrick had never seen the creek because of the thick foliage, but now that it had burned he saw the slender slick of water crawling through the ravine no faster than a snake. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to be home,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>Ted looked over at him with solemn admiration on his face. He was twenty-six, four years older than his brother. &#x201c;Did you see some bad things over there?&#x201d;</p> <p>The admiration made Patrick uneasy. He&#x2019;d done little to deserve it, but Ted had always adored him, always tried to look out for him. Patrick thought of the cards that life can deal, right from the start, such as bad feet and the fever and seizures that had found Ted in his crib and almost killed him. And how Ted&#x2019;s life had been a series of quiet failures.</p> <p>&#x201c;You did good for your country, Pat. I&#x2019;m proud of you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be. I did what everybody else did.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Heroes always say that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There were heroes but I&#x2019;m not one of them. I&#x2019;ll tell you something, Ted&#x2014;that war was a waste. It sounds like I&#x2019;m against my country but I&#x2019;m not. I would have died for my guys. Some of them died for me. But it was supposed to mean something bigger and it didn&#x2019;t. Just a lot of death for nothing. Just a lot of Marines getting shot at and blown up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you helped the people over there.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. The villagers are already halfway back to the Stone Age where we found them. They won&#x2019;t change because they don&#x2019;t want to. So it doesn&#x2019;t mean anything, if they won&#x2019;t even try to hang on to what we accomplished. It just means we were there and then we were gone. Like footprints. There were some good things, too. I had my men and a dog. He smelled out bombs. He saved some lives. I already miss it, but not the things I thought I&#x2019;d miss.&#x201d;</p> <p>Patrick looked at his brother. Ted was big and pale. He had shaved his head and gotten a new tattoo&#x2014;a bracelet of POW barbed wire&#x2014;around one wrist. It looked wrong on him, Patrick thought. Ted had never been a prisoner of anything except his own misfortunes. The tattoo should be &#x201c;Mom&#x201d; or a heart with a girl&#x2019;s name inside it, thought Patrick. He knew from texts and Skypes that while he was in Sangin, Ted was driving a taxi and taking classes at the state university in San Marcos. And that three weeks ago Ted had broken up with yet another girlfriend. There was always a woman who Ted loved but didn&#x2019;t love him. Then another. Maybe a girlfriend tattoo wasn&#x2019;t such a good idea after all.</p> <p>&#x201c;The big memorial for the Dark Horses is next week,&#x201d; said Ted. &#x201c;Third Battalion, Fifth Regiment. I always liked the sound of your unit. <i>The Three-Five. Get Some!</i> Pendleton&#x2019;s flying in Marines and families from all around the country. Speeches, Color Guard, everything. Mom and Dad already got a written invite signed by a real brigadier general.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I heard about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you going to go?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I could of done what you did. Too bad I always screw up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re off the drugs, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off the thirties <i>and</i> the booze.&#x201d; Patrick knew that thirties were 30 milligram OxyContin, &#x201c;hillbilly heroin,&#x201d; an addictive prescription painkiller. Ted&#x2019;s addiction had been discovered by his mother a year ago, about the time Patrick was walking his first patrols of the poppy fields in the Sanjin District. The coincidence puzzled Patrick. He had come to see that life was often made of pieces that didn&#x2019;t fit.</p> <p>&#x201c;You did your part, Ted. You got clean and you&#x2019;re back in school.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was. The college expelled me for some stuff I put on the Internet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What stuff?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I did a cartoon of Mayor Anders.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Damn you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s freedom of speech, Pat. I&#x2019;m really sick of her and the rest of government, collecting all my tax money and spending it on things we don&#x2019;t need. We didn&#x2019;t need the new library. What was wrong with the old one? And how big a pension will she and her friends at City Hall get? How come they didn&#x2019;t spend the money on more firemen? It&#x2019;s government waste of our dollars, Patrick. Why can&#x2019;t I say that? So I drew a cartoon of her as a dealer at a blackjack table. She&#x2019;s leaning over to push big stacks of chips to a homeless family on welfare. I exaggerated her breast size. The college said it was against women, hateful and antigovernment. I&#x2019;m expelled. But I&#x2019;m not charged with anything.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Damn you, Ted. Can&#x2019;t you leave anything alone?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean anything by it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You <i>want</i> to mean something by it, Ted! That&#x2019;s the whole point. You piss me off.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ted frowned grimly and pulled a CD from the door slot. &#x201c;Listen to this music, Pat. It&#x2019;s Cruzela Storm. She&#x2019;s local and she&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Patrick snatched the plastic case away from his brother. &#x201c;If you won&#x2019;t control yourself, who will?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same old thing, Patrick. Ideas get into me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know, and you say you don&#x2019;t know where they come from. Bullshit. You&#x2019;re too old for that excuse now.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I hurt her feelings. But when the ideas get into me I don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re going to look like when they come back out. Does anyone? I don&#x2019;t have anything personal against Mayor Anders. I apologized on her Web site and never heard back. There&#x2019;s no talk of charges. Nothing like that. But there&#x2019;s good news, too, Pat. I&#x2019;m spending sixty hours a week in my taxi. <i>Sixty.</i> And making some serious money.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Patrick let his head rock back against the rest and watched the scorched earth scroll past his window. He saw Ted lean his head back, too. A campaign poster for Mayor Evelyn Anders, apparently running for re-election next month, flashed by. On blackened chain-link fence along the road, the families of returning troops had already hung new signs and banners welcoming home their Pendleton-based husbands and fathers and daughters. WE LOVE YOU, JASON! XOXOXO! WELCOME HOME, TAMARA!</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s yours, Pat! We made it ourselves, soon as the fire got put out.&#x201d;</p> <p>Patrick looked at the clean white banner hanging on the fence, the red-and-blue lettering and the goofily oversized image of his serious Marine Corps face under his dress cover. He was surprised how young he looked and how old he felt. He thought of Myers and Zane and the others dead in Sangin, and of Salimony and Messina and Bostik, alive here in California.</p> <p><i>You can&#x2019;t dwell on all the times you should have died or it&#x2019;ll drive you crazy. Look at the guys who won&#x2019;t ever get to think back on that war. Look at the guys it ate alive. Then look at yourself and figure out the difference between them and you. There isn&#x2019;t any.</i></p> <p>Coming into town from the east, Patrick saw that the fire had been capricious, destroying one grove but sparing another, burning one house to the ground and ignoring the next. Like snipers, he thought, or mortar rounds. He saw Valley Pumpkin Patch, with straw Halloween witches on strings hanging from the surrounding sycamores, and acres of big orange pumpkins stretching away. He&#x2019;d run in those fields as a boy. He had always loved the fall here. Now his heart ached in a general way and he sensed there was much more to come.</p> <p>Downtown looked much as he had left it, but there were many more empty storefronts. He was surprised how many FOR RENT or FOR LEASE signs these were. Even the Navy recruiter was closed and empty. The east side was mostly Mexican businesses&#x2014;markets and the bakery, the shoe and music stores. Here the streets and sidewalks were busy with young mothers pushing strollers, older women carrying plastic shopping bags in both hands for balance, and kids on foot and on bikes. By the number of youngsters out on this afternoon, Norris guessed that Fallbrook schools were not in session because of the fire. It cheered his heart to see people walking around, living their lives without carrying guns or getting shot at or wondering where the IEDs were hidden. They don&#x2019;t know how good they have it, he thought.</p> <p>Farther down Main Street were most of the nice older buildings&#x2014;City Hall, the community theater, and the banks and restaurants, the dance studio and the Art and Cultural Center, hair salons and art galleries. A taqueira boasted the world&#x2019;s best tacos while a drive-through claimed the world&#x2019;s best burgers. Patrick liked the world-class braggadocio in his small town.</p> <p>And he also liked that here in Fallbrook, Japanese owned the sushi places, Chinese families ran the Chinese restaurants, Koreans owned the Korean restaurants, Indians ran the smoke shop, Pakis the liquor stores, and Mexicans the <i>carnecerias, zapaterias,</i> and <i>joyer�as.</i> There were blacks, mostly stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton. There were California Indians&#x2014;Cahuilla and Rincon and Pala&#x2014;descended through the centuries, clannish and proud. And Guatemalans, almost all of them males, some very young and their shirts always tucked in tightly, who toiled as field hands and gardeners.</p> <p>AVOCADO CAPITAL OF THE WORLD! Patrick looked up at the smoke-smudged banners on Main Street and smiled. He recalled from fourth-grade history that Fallbrook was originally plotted as a town site in 1885, declaring itself dry of alcohol. He had gotten out the local phone book that night, to find that Fallbrook had thirty-one churches, one synagogue, three taverns, and four tattoo parlors. He thought of Fallbrook as a shrunk-down version of the republic.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by T.

Strausenback is a thread that runs through much of the park&#39;s history. Beginning in 1900, when he was just 10 years old, he carved and sold gypsum figures from a tripod stand near Gateway Rocks. As an adult, he operated various curio stores in and around the park, partnering with Carl Balcomb at Hidden Inn, then with Curt Goerke at Balanced Rock and The Indian trading post. In 1929, Strausenback realized his dream of owning a curio store with the construction of the Trading Post, where he employed Navajo and Pueblo Indians as silversmiths and entertainers. His legacy and the rich history of the trading post remain intact at the southwest edge of the park, now the oldest continuously operated trading post in Colorado.</p><p>Pat and Kim Messier, native Arizonans, are authors of two volumes on Native American art. Their previous research inspired this book, and the photographs within are from the authors&#39; collection, Garden of the Gods Trading Post, and the Heard Museum. Diana F.

Each of them at a different stage in life, each of them away from home, and each of them striving--in the suburbs of Prague, in an overdeveloped Alpine village, beside a Belgian motorway, in a dingy Cyprus hotel--to understand what it means to be alive, here and now. Tracing a dramatic arc from the spring of youth to the winter of old age, the ostensibly separate narratives of <i>All That Man Is</i> aggregate into a picture of a single shared existence, a picture that interrogates the state of modern manhood while bringing to life, unforgettably, the physical and emotional terrain of an increasingly globalized Europe. And so these nine lives form an ingenious and new kind of novel, in which David Szalay expertly plots a dark predicament for the twenty-first-century man. </p><p>Dark and disturbing, but also often wickedly and uproariously comic, <i>All That Man Is </i>is notable for the acute psychological penetration Szalay brings to bear on his characters, from the working-class ex-grunt to the pompous college student, the middle-aged loser to the Russian oligarch. Steadily and mercilessly, as this brilliantly conceived book progresses, the protagonist at the center of each chapter is older than the last one, it gets colder out, and <i>All That Man Is </i>gathers exquisite power. Szalay is a writer of supreme gifts--a master of a new kind of realism that vibrates with detail, intelligence, relevance, and devastating pathos.</p></p><p><b>David Szalay</b> is the author of<i> London and the South-East</i>, which won the Betty Trask Prize and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize; <i>The Innocent</i>; and <i>Spring</i>.<i> </i>In 2013 he was named one of <i>Granta</i>'s Best of Young British Novelists.

This absorbing book features many of the most famous and historically significant cameras ever produced from the 1930s through the 1990s. Famous American brands such as Imperial, Kodak, Spartus, Polaroid, and Argus are shown, as well as early cameras from Beacon, Packard, and Falcon. Camera types include rangefinder, viewfinder, and single lens reflex, plus foldouts, instants, premiums, plastic art cameras, and even disposables. Here too are many American made movie cameras from Bell &amp; Howell, Kodak, Revere, DeJur, Technicolor, and Keystone, along with Japanese models from Yashica and Chinon and the popular Swiss made Bolex. Though no longer being produced, many of these wonderful older cameras are still available to collectors and are surprisingly inexpensive. Valuable information on where to find them, what to pay, and how to start or add to your own collection is provided.</p><p>Scott Faragher is a resident of Nashville, Tennessee, where he studies and collects cameras.

But in a society obsessed with appearance, wealth, and status, it's easy for problematic narcissists to thrive. Many people who seem to "have it all" are suffering from one of the most common--and overlooked--personality disorders of our time: high level narcissism. Typified by an obsession with perfection, a desperate need for admiration, and a willingness to use and exploit others for personal gain, high level narcissism can spell devastation for anyone who crosses the narcissist's path.<br> <br> In <i>Freeing Yourself from the Narcissist in Your Life</i>, psychotherapist <b>Linda Martinez-Lewi</b> presents an in-depth and supportive plan for identifying, understanding, and dealing with high level narcissistic behavior in those close to you. Martinez-Lewi helps you to liberate yourself from draining personal relationships with narcissists, and shows how to regain a sense of peace, balance, and well-being.<br> <br> Drawing on detailed profiles of famous narcissists, including Pablo Picasso, Frank Lloyd Wright, Armand Hammer, and Ayn Rand, as well as expertly rendered case studies from her private practice as a psychotherapist, <b>Martinez-Lewi</b> <i>shows how to:<br> <br> - understand where narcissistic behavior comes from;<br> - learn to spot narcissistic traits, even in the early stages of relationships;<br> - realize why attempting to change a narcissist is fruitless; and<br> - protect yourself from the narcissist's opportunism, manipulative behavior, and lack of empathy.</i></p><p>"Psychotherapist Martinez-Lewi combines clinical analysis with psychological profiles of famous people she believes to have been narcissists (e.g., Frank Lloyd Wright, Ayn Rand) in this valuable guide to recognizing, coping with, and overcoming narcissistic behavior. She focuses on the high-level narcissist, i.e., the "omnipotent, grandiose, often charismatic individual of overreaching ambition and palpable hubris," distinguishing diagnostically between narcissists and borderline and antisocial personalities. She further presents a historical and societal perspective on narcissism, explaining the shift in focus in psychopathology from neuroses to personality disorders. Throughout, she draws on solid secondary biographies as well as relevant case studies from her private practice, and she ends with a reasoned discussion of decidedly Eastern approaches (e.g., meditation) to counter narcissists&#x2019; destructive behavior. The book is written with a calm directness and achieves the author&#x2019;s purpose of helping readers identify and protect themselves from naively tangling with these personalities. It offers more clinical analysis and experience than does Eleanor Payson&#x2019;s The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists and nicely complements Nina W. Brown&#x2019;s Children of the Self-Absorbed. Highly recommended for university and larger public libraries. <br> <br>&#x2013;Dale Farris, Library Journal<b>Linda Martinez-Lewi</b>, Ph.D., is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.

To investigate, Borl� must travel from the decaying Beszel to its equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the vibrant city of Ul Qoma. But this is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a seeing of the unseen. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, Borl� is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman&#x2019;s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2009:</strong> The city is Beszel, a rundown metropolis on the eastern edge of Europe. The other city is Ul Qoma, a modern Eastern European boomtown, despite being a bit of an international pariah. What the two cities share, and what they don't, is the deliciously evocative conundrum at the heart of China Mieville's <em>The City &amp; The City</em>. Mieville is well known as a modern fantasist (and urbanist), but from book to book he's tried on different genres, and here he's fully hard-boiled, stripping down to a seen-it-all detective's voice that's wonderfully appropriate for this story of seen and unseen. His detective is Inspector Tyador Borlu, a cop in Beszel whose investigation of the murder of a young foreign woman takes him back and forth across the highly policed border to Ul Qoma to uncover a crime that threatens the delicate balance between the cities and, perhaps more so, Borlu's own dissolving sense of identity. In his tale of two cities, Mieville creates a world both fantastic and unsettlingly familiar, whose mysteries don't end with the solution of a murder. --<em>Tom Nissley</em>China Mi�ville is the author of <b>King Rat</b>; <b>Perdido Street Station,</b> winner of the Arthur C.

South Africa, for its part, was controlled by a regime of Afrikaner nationalists who had enthusiastically supported Hitler during World War II.<br>&nbsp;<br>But after Israel&#x2019;s occupation of Palestinian territories in 1967, the country found itself estranged from former allies and threatened anew by old enemies. As both states became international pariahs, their covert military relationship blossomed: they exchanged billions of dollars&#x2019; worth of extremely sensitive material, including nuclear technology, boosting Israel&#x2019;s sagging economy and strengthening the beleaguered apartheid regime.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time the right-wing Likud Party came to power in 1977, Israel had all but abandoned the moralism of its founders in favor of close and lucrative ties with South Africa. For nearly twenty years, Israel denied these ties, claiming that it opposed apartheid on moral and religious grounds even as it secretly supplied the arsenal of a white supremacist government.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasha Polakow-Suransky reveals the previously classified details of countless arms deals conducted behind the backs of Israel&#x2019;s own diplomatic corps and in violation of a United Nations arms embargo. Based on extensive archival research and exclusive interviews with former generals and high-level government officials in both countries, <i>The Unspoken Alliance </i>tells a troubling story of Cold War paranoia, moral compromises, and Israel&#x2019;s estrangement from the left. It is essential reading for anyone interested in Israel&#x2019;s history and its future.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Sasha Polakow-Suransky</b> is a senior editor at <i>Foreign Affairs</i> and holds a doctorate in modern history from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar from 2003 to 2006.

After passing solemnly through the corridors commemorating those gassed in Auschwitz and Dachau, he entered the dimly lit Hall of Remembrance, where a memorial flame burned alongside a crypt filled with the ashes of Holocaust victims. Vorster bowed his head as a South African minister read a psalm in Afrikaans, the haunting melody of the Jewish prayer for the dead filling the room. He then kneeled and laid a wreath, containing the colors of the South African flag, in memory of Hitler&#x2019;s victims. Cameras snapped, dignitaries applauded, and Israeli officials quickly ferried the prime minister away to his next destination.1 Back in Johannesburg, the opposition journalist Benjamin Pogrund was sickened as he watched the spectacle on television. Thousands of South African Jews shared Pogrund&#x2019;s disgust; they knew all too well that Vorster had another, darker past.<br><br>In addition to being the architect of South Africa&#x2019;s brutal crackdown on the black democratic opposition and the hand behind many a tortured activist and imprisoned leader, Vorster and his intelligence chief, Hendrik van den Bergh, had served as generals in the Ossewa Brandwag, a militant Afrikaner nationalist organization that had openly supported the Nazis during World War II.<br><br>The group&#x2019;s leader, Hans van Rensburg, was an enthusiastic admirer of Adolf Hitler. In conversations with Nazi leaders in 1940, van Rensburg formally offered to provide the Third Reich with hundreds of thousands of men in order to stage a coup and bring an Axis- friendly government to power at the strategically vital southern tip of Africa. Lacking adequate arms supplies, van Rensburg&#x2019;s men eventually abandoned their plans for regime change and settled for industrial sabotage, bombings, and bank robberies. South Africa&#x2019;s British-aligned government con sidered the organization so dangerous that it imprisoned many of its members.<br><br>But Vorster was unapologetic and proudly compared his nation to Nazi Germany: &#x201c;We stand for Christian Nationalism which is an ally of National Socialism . . . you can call such an anti- democratic system a dictatorship if you like,&#x201d; he declared in 1942. &#x201c;In Italy it is called Fascism, in Germany National Socialism and in South Africa Christian Nationalism.&#x201d; As a result of their pro-Nazi activities, Vorster and van den Bergh were declared enemies of the state and detained in a government camp.<br><br>Three decades later, as Vorster toured Yad Vashem, the Israeli government was still scouring the globe for former Nazis&#x2014; extraditing or even kidnapping them in order to try them in Israeli courts. Yet Vorster, a man who was once a self- proclaimed Nazi supporter and who remained wedded to a policy of racial superiority, found himself in Jerusalem receiving full red-carpet treatment at the invitation of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.<br><br>&nbsp;� � �<br><br><b>PRIOR TO 1967,</b> Israel was a celebrated cause of the left. The nascent Jewish state, since its creation amid the ashes of Auschwitz, was widely recognized as a triumph for justice and human rights. Leftists across the world, with the notable exception of those in Muslim nations, identified with the socialist pioneering spirit of the new nation. Africans welcomed Israeli development aid and voted in Israel&#x2019;s favor at the United Nations. Europeans for the most part supported the Jewish state, often out of socialist idealism or sheer guilt. Even Britain, which fought Jewish guerrilla organizations until the eve of Israel&#x2019;s independence in 1948, recognized the state of Israel in January 1949. Although the South African Jewish community became the largest per capita financial contributor to Israel after 1948, relations between the two countries&#x2019; governments were cordial but chilly for much of the 1950s.<br><br>In the 1960s, Israeli leaders&#x2019; ideological hostility toward apartheid kept the two nations apart. During these years, Israel took a strong and unequivocal stance against South Africa. In 1963, Foreign Minister Golda Meir told the United Nations General Assembly that Israelis &#x201c;naturally oppose policies of apartheid, colonialism and racial or religious discrimination wherever they exist&#x201d; due to Jews&#x2019; historical experience as victims of oppression. Israel even offered asylum to South Africa&#x2019;s most wanted man.<br><br>In addition to condemning apartheid, Meir forged close ties with the newly independent states of Africa, offering them everything from agricultural assistance to military training. Many African leaders accepted invitations to Israel and some, impressed with the Israeli army, decided to hire Israeli bodyguards. African states returned the favor by voting with Israel at the U.N. in an era when the Jewish state had few diplomatic allies. At the time, black American leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. were also outspoken in their support of Israel, likening criticism of Zionism to anti-Semitism.<br><br>Things began to change with Israel&#x2019;s stunning victory over its Arab neighbors in the Six-Day War of 1967, which tripled the size of the Jewish state in less than a week. The post-1967 military occupation of Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian territory and the settlement project that soon followed planted hundreds of thousands of Jews on hilltops and in urban centers throughout the newly conquered West Bank and Gaza Strip, saddling Israel with the stigma of occupation and forever tarring it with the colonialist brush.<br><br>Israelis did not take kindly to the colonial label. After all, Zionism had in many ways been an anti-imperial movement. The World Zionist Organization may have mimicked European colonial settlement tactics in the early 1900s, but by the 1940s Zionism&#x2019;s more extreme proponents were fighting to oust the British Mandate government in Palestine. Consequently, many Israelis saw their independence as a postcolonial triumph akin to the successful liberation struggles of newly independent African and Asian countries and they bristled at any attempt to equate Zionism with European colonialism.<br><br>Conquest and expansion had not been part of the IDF&#x2019;s (the Israel Defense Forces) strategic planning for a war that it perceived as a defensive struggle for survival. Even Israel&#x2019;s leaders were shocked by the extent of their territorial gains in the Six- Day War. Indeed, before the shooting stopped, the first internal military memos proposed withdrawing almost completely from the newly acquired territories in exchange for peace with the Arab states. Yet, as Arab negotiating positions hardened and religious Zionists and socialist idealists alike sought to redeem and settle the land, the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and the Sinai Peninsula slowly transformed Israel into an unwitting outpost of colonialism.<br><br>Aided by a healthy dose of Arab and Soviet propaganda, Israel&#x2019;s image as a state of Holocaust survivors in need of protection gradually deteriorated into that of an imperialist stooge of the West. As criticism of Israel mounted and Arab states dangled dollars and oil in the faces of poor African nations in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Third World countries increasingly switched allegiance. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, all but a few African countries severed diplomatic ties with the Jewish state, and the Israeli government abandoned the last vestiges of moral foreign policy in favor of hard-nosed realpolitik. <br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t long before Israel initiated defense cooperation with some of the world&#x2019;s most notoriously brutal regimes, including Argentina&#x2019;s military dictatorship, Pinochet&#x2019;s Chile, and apartheid South Africa.<br>At its core, the Israeli&#x2013;South African relationship was a marriage of interests and ideologies. Israel profited handsomely from arms exports and South Africa gained access to cutting-edge weaponry at a time when the rest of the world was turning against the apartheid state. For the next twenty years, a Janus- faced Israel denied its ties with South Africa, claiming that it opposed apartheid on moral and religious grounds even as it secretly strengthened the arsenal of a white supremacist government. <br><br>Israel and South Africa joined forces at a precarious and auspicious time. The alliance began in earnest after the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, and shared military and economic interests drove the relationship for the next three years. Though both countries were receiving varying degrees of support from the United States, neither enjoyed a defense pact with Washington and both were wary of relying too heavily on the Americans for their survival&#x2014; especially in the early 1970s, when unconditional U.S. support for Israel was by no means assured. This alliance exposed Israel to great risks in the realm of public relations, especially when the Jewish state&#x2019;s legitimacy was already under attack at the U.N. from pro-Palestinian groups and aligning itself with the hated apartheid regime threatened to tarnish its reputation further.<br><br>Rabin&#x2019;s Labor Party government, which ruled the country from 1974 to 1977, did not share the ethnic nationalist ideology of South Africa&#x2019;s rulers, but Israel&#x2019;s war-battered industries desperately needed export markets and the possibility of lucrative trade with South Africa was hard for Defense Minister Shimon Peres to resist. As Rabin, Peres, and a new generation of leaders inherited the party from David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir, the conviction that compromising certain values was necessary for survival gained sway and socialist idealism gave way to realpolitik. During the Rabin years, South African arms purchases breathed life into the Israeli economy and Israeli weapons helped to reinforce the beleaguered and isolated apartheid regime in Pretoria.<br><br>The impact of their...</p><h2>Making Waves: An Anthology of Writings By and About Asian American Women</h2><p>Gathers poems, essays, and stories about the experiences of Asian-American women</p><p>Asian Women United of California is a nonprofit organization founded in 1976. The group has produced several books and films.This potent, fertile collection of fiction, poetry and essays by 53 Asian-American women challenges stereotypes of female docility and subservience that stigmatize those whose roots are in China, Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, Korea, etc. Only a few of the startlingly forthright voices are well-known outside the Asian-American literary and scholarly milieus: Cathy Song, for example, won the 1983 Yale Series of Younger Poets award and Kitty Tsui is a widely read poet in feminist circles. Yet all have messages to convey, and do so in the incandescent language of those struggling for survival in a hostile environment. Contributors here discuss the realities of immigrating to an alien land; the history of Asian-American women's work in the trades and professions; anger at injustices they confront as women and as Asians; and the activism that has helped them to discover their identities. South Asia Bulletin co-publisher Sucheta Mazumdar's introduction, "A Woman-Centered Perspective on Asian American History," provides valuable context for the kaleidoscopic views expressed in this remarkable volume. Asian Women United of California, whose members edited and contributed to Making Waves , is a nonprofit organization founded in 1976 to promote the social, economic and general welfare of Asian-American women.

Sure, they had some quality pitchers, but the Giants roster consisted of a rag-tag group of castoffs, oddballs, rookies, and old-timers who seemed a lot more entertaining off the field than on it. After 53 years of futility, San Francisco was hungry for a baseball championship...but the 2010 Giants? Then, as the season waned, some type of magic descended on the Bay Area and enveloped the club, leading them to the most miraculous of championships. How the Giants came together as a team and shocked the country all the while, doing things in their own offbeat fashion is one of baseball s all-time great stories.<br><br>In <em>Band of Misfits</em>, Andrew Baggarly longtime Giants beat writer for the San Jose Mercury News shines a light on the colorful characters (lovingly labeled the Dirty Dozen by manager Bruce Bochy) who became stars during San Francisco s crazy ride to the top, including Aubrey Huff and his now-legendary Rally Thong; clean-cut rookie extraordinaire Buster Posey; and laissez faire Tim Lincecum, whose laid-back personality is a perfect fit for the City by the Bay. Behind every madcap misadventure there was also an unquenchable drive to succeed and prove the naysayers wrong. Too young, too old, not good enough? This team never bought into those excuses. Every baseball fan will love Baggarly's inside stories of The Misfits run to the title.</p><p>"Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, and Marichal--Hall of Famers all--couldn't do it. Nor could The Thrill, Matty, and Mitchell. Not even Bonds, Kent, and Nen. No, in 52 seasons in the City by the Bay, the Giants had never won a World Series. And then, suddenly, the 2010 Giants won it...emphatically, against all odds, despite being labeled a band of misfits. What a story! And it's all recounted here, in vivid, behind-the-scenes detail. Every Giants fan must have this book!"<br><br>--Jon Miller, Hall of Fame announcer and Giants play-by-play voice<br><br><br>"After being a part of the Giants organization for so many years, it was an honor - and excruciatingly fun -- to watch this team in 2010. I was as happy for them as if I'd won the World Series myself, and there's no better writer to cover this great season than Andy Baggarly. He is one of the few members of the media who is there day in and day out and who truly understands the game of baseball."<br><br> --Rich Aurilia, former Giants infielder<br><br> <br> "All year long, Andy Baggarly was the must-read beat writer for the 2010 Giants. Now that the 2010 Giants have achieved immortality, Andy has become the must-read author to etch these indelible players and moments into lore. Anecdotes, insights, context, humor, ball knowledge and, yes, goosebumps are the result. In Giants-speak, let's just say Baggs NAILED IT."<br><br> --Brian Murphy, host of "Murph and Mac" morning show on KNBR Radio<br> <br><br>"There are still millions of Americans wondering how Barry Bonds, Willie McCovey and Juan Marichal could have avoided winning a World Series in San Francisco - but a team that called itself The Misfits did. Well, thank heaven Andy Baggarly came along to explain it all so eloquently in this amazing book. It took a great writer and reporter to unearth the mysteries behind Aubrey Huff's thong, Brian Wilson's beard and this team's magical journey. And reading these riveting tales reminded me again why Andy Baggarly is one of the best baseball writers in America."<br><br> --Jayson Stark, ESPNAndrew Baggarly is the Giants beat reporter for the San Jose Mercury News and has covered the team home and away for the past seven seasons.

His candid memoirs offer a unique eyewitness account of events leading up to and during the war, culminating in those dark final days in the F�hrer's headquarters, deep under the shattered city of Berlin.<br><br>He begins by describing his duties as a member of Hitler&#x2019;s personal staff in the years preceding the war, driving the F�hrer throughout Germany and abroad, and accompanying him to rallies. The crux of his memoirs however covers his life with Hitler in the Berlin F�hrerbunker. During this time he was responsible for a transport fleet of cars, and often drove the likes of Speer or Kesselring on inspection tours to the hot spots on the front; and in March 1945, he accompanied the F�hrer to his final front-inspection tour. Kempka was also present when news came through of G�ring and Himmler&#x2019;s efforts to seize power and negotiate a truce with the Western Allies.<br><br>Crucially, Kempka also witnessed Hitler&#x2019;s marriage to Eva Braun, and his last dinner and personal farewell to all those present, before he and his wife committed suicide.

In 1970, the ratio of pay between the top 100 CEOs and the average worker was 45 to 1. Today it is a shocking 829 to one! During that time a new economic philosophy set in that cut taxes, deregulated finance, and trimmed social spending. Those policies set in motion a process that greatly expanded the power of financial interests to accelerate inequality. But how exactly does that happen?</p> <p>Using easy-to-understand charts and graphs, <em>Runaway Inequality</em> explains the process by which corporation after corporation falls victim to systematic wealth extraction by banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds. It reveals how financial strip-mining puts enormous downward pressure on jobs, wages, benefits, and working conditions, while boosting the incomes of financial elites.</p> <p>But <em>Runaway Inequality</em> does more than make sense of our economic plight. It also shows why virtually all the key issues that we face&#x2015;from climate change to the exploding prison population&#x2015;are intimately connected to rising economic inequality.</p> <p>Most importantly, <em>Runaway Inequality</em> calls upon us to build a common movement to tackle the sources of increasing income and wealth inequality. As the author makes clear, the problem will not cure itself. It will take enormous energy and dedication to bring economic justice and fairness back to American society.</p> <p>The book is divided into four parts:</p> <ul> <li>Part I: What is the fundamental cause of runaway economic inequality? What has made our economy less fair and left most of us less secure?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Part II: How does the United States really compare with other major developed countries?&nbsp; How do we stack up on quality of life, health, and well-being?</li> <li>Part III:&nbsp; What does economic inequality have to do with so many of the critical issues we face, including taxes, debt, education, criminal justice, racism, climate change, foreign trade, and war?</li> <li>Part IV: What concrete steps can we take to begin building a fair and just society?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>From the book: &#x201c;<em>There is nothing in the economic universe that will automatically rescue us from runaway inequality. There is no pendulum, no invisible political force that &#x2018;naturally&#x2019; will swing back towards economic fairness.

He has numerous <i>New York Times</i> adult best-sellers, including his most recent <i>From The Corner Of His Eye.</i> Dean Koontz is also the author of the children's book <i>Santa's Twin.</i> He lives in southern California.Grade 2-5&#x2013;In this sequel to <i>Santa's Twin</i> (Morrow, 1996), the big man's brother Bob tries to help out by building a robotic Santa and reindeer, and trains a gorilla to drive the rocket-powered sleigh. Sure enough, things go wrong; by the time the surrogate St. Nick reaches his first house, he's having major software trouble and is downright scary. Meanwhile, the gorilla takes over the kitchen and starts cooking up a storm. Luckily, Emily and Lottie (stars of the first book) restore order and sanity, with some help from their dog Woofer and the real Santa. The tale is told in many, many rhyming stanzas, which can be rather exhausting to read, but there are enough laughs, wordplay, and clever twists to hold the interest of most kids, especially if they hear it read aloud. The illustrations are slick, smooth, and rather stiff, which works well with the robotic characters but not so well with the real ones; Emily and Lottie look as though they are made of plastic. If <i>Santa's Twin</i> is popular at your library, this title will be a hit as well.<i>&#x2013;E. M.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She forgets things she should know-what year it is, major events in the lives of her children. But she remembers things that don't seem possible. She remembers marrying Mark and having four children. And she remembers not marrying Mark and raising three children with Bee instead. She remembers the bomb that killed President Kennedy in 1963, and she remembers Kennedy in 1964, declining to run again after the nuclear exchange that took out Miami and Kiev.</p><p>Her childhood, her years at Oxford during the Second World War-those were solid things. But after that, did she marry Mark or not? Did her friends all call her Trish, or Pat? Had she been a housewife who escaped a terrible marriage after her children were grown, or a successful travel writer with homes in Britain and Italy? And the moon outside her window: does it host a benign research station, or a command post bristling with nuclear missiles?</p><p>Two lives, two worlds, two versions of modern history; each with their loves and losses, their sorrows and triumphs.

Less confused. Very confused.&#x201d; That last was written frequently, sometimes abbreviated by the nurses to just &#x201c;VC,&#x201d; which made her smile, as if she were sufficiently confused to be given a medal for it. Her name was on the notes too&#x2014;just her first name, Patricia, as if in old age she were demoted to childhood, and denied both the dignity of surname and title and the familiarity of the form of her name she preferred. The notes reminded her of a school report with the little boxes and fixed categories into which it was so difficult to express the real complexity of any situation. &#x201c;Spelling atrocious.&#x201d; &#x201c;Needs to pay attention.&#x201d; &#x201c;Confused today.&#x201d; They seemed remote and Olympian and impossible to appeal. &#x201c;But Miss!&#x201d; the kids would say in more recent years. She would never have dared when she was in school, and neither would the obedient girls of her first years of teaching. &#x201c;But Miss!&#x201d; was a product of their growing confidence, trickle-down feminism, and she welcomed it even as it made her daily work harder. She wanted to say it now herself to the nurses who added to her notes: &#x201c;But Miss! I&#x2019;m only a little confused today!&#x201d; <br>The notes hung clipped to the end of her bed. They listed her medication, the stuff for her heart she had been taking for years since the first attack. She was grateful that they remembered it for her now, the abrupt Latin syllables. She liked to check the notes from time to time, even though the staff discouraged it if they caught her at it. The notes had the date, which otherwise was hard to remember, and even the day of the week, which she so easily lost track of here, where all days were alike. She could even forget what time of year it was, going out so seldom, which she would have thought impossible. Not knowing the season really was a sign of severe confusion. <br>Sometimes, especially at first, she looked at the notes to see how confused she appeared to them, but often lately she forgot, and then forgot what she had forgotten to do among the constant morass of things she needed to keep track of and the endless muddle of notes reminding herself of what she had meant to do. She had found a list once that began &#x201c;Make list.&#x201d; VC, the attendants would have written if they had seen it; but that was long before the dementia began, when she had been still quite young, although she had not thought so at the time. She had never felt older than those years when the children were small and so demanding of her attention. She had felt it a new lease on youth when they were grown and gone, and the constant drain on her time and caring was relieved. Not that she had ever stopped caring. Even now when she saw their faces, impossibly middle-aged, she felt that same burden of unconditional loving tugging at her, their needs and problems, and her inability to keep them safe and give them what they wanted. <br>It was when she thought of her children that she was most truly confused. Sometimes she knew with solid certainty that she had four children, and five more stillbirths: nine times giving birth in floods of blood and pain, and of those, four surviving. At other times she knew equally well that she had two children, both born by caesarean section late in her life after she had given up hope. Two children of her body, and another, a stepchild, dearest of them all. When any of them visited she knew them, knew how many of them there were, and the other knowledge felt like a dream. She couldn&#x2019;t understand how she could be so muddled. If she saw Philip she knew he was one of her three children, yet if she saw Cathy she knew she was one of her four children. She recognized them and felt that mother&#x2019;s ache. She was not yet as confused as her own mother had been at last when she had not known her, had wept and fled from her and accused her of terrible crimes. She knew that time would come, when her children and grandchildren would be strangers. She had watched her mother&#x2019;s decline and knew what lay ahead. In her constant struggle to keep track of her glasses and her hearing aid and her book it was this that she dreaded, the day when they came and she did not know them, when she would respond to Sammy politely as to a stranger, or worse, in horror as to an enemy. <br>She was glad for their sake that they didn&#x2019;t have to witness it every day, as she had done. She was glad they had found her this nursing home, even if it seemed to shift around her from day to day, abruptly thrusting out new wings or folding up on itself to make a wall where yesterday there had been a corridor. She knew there was a lift, and yet when the nurses told her that was nonsense she took the stairlift as docilely as she could. She remembered her mother struggling and fighting and insisting, and let it go. When the lift was there again she wanted to tell the nurse in triumph that she had been right, but it was a different nurse. And what was more likely, after all&#x2014;that it was the dementia (&#x201c;VC&#x201d;), or that place kept changing? They were gentle and well-meaning, she wasn&#x2019;t going to ascribe their actions to malice as her mother had so easily ascribed everything. Still, if she was going to forget some things and remember others, why couldn&#x2019;t she forget the anguish of her mother&#x2019;s long degeneration and remember where she had put down her hearing aids? <br>Two of the nurses were taking her down to the podiatrist one day&#x2014;she was so frail now that she needed one on each side to help her shuffle down the corridor. They stood waiting for the elusive lift, which appeared to be back in existence today. The wall by the lift was painted an institutional green, like many of the schools where she had taught. It was a color nobody chose for their home, but which any committee thought appropriate for a school or a hospital or a nursing home. Hanging on the wall was a reproduction of a painting, a field of poppies. It wasn&#x2019;t Monet as she had thought on earlier casual glances; it was one of the Second Impressionist school of the Seventies. &#x201c;Pamela Corey,&#x201d; she said, remembering. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the male nurse said, patronizing as ever. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s David Hockney. Corey painted the picture of the ruins of Miami we have in the little day room.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I taught her,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;No, did you?&#x201d; the female nurse asked. &#x201c;Fancy having taught somebody famous like that, helped somebody become a real artist.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I taught her English, not art,&#x201d; Pat said, as the lift came and they all three went in. &#x201c;I do remember encouraging her to go on to the Royal Academy.&#x201d; Pamela Corey had been thin and passionate in the sixth form, and torn between Oxford and painting. She remembered talking to her about safe and unsafe choices, and what one might regret. <br>&#x201c;Somebody famous,&#x201d; the female nurse repeated, breaking her train of thought. <br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t famous then,&#x201d; Pat said. &#x201c;Nobody is. You never know until too late. They&#x2019;re just people like everyone else. Anyone you know might become famous. Or not. You don&#x2019;t know which ones will make a difference or if any of them will. You might become famous yourself. You might change the world.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bit late for that now,&#x201d; the nurse said, laughing that little deprecating laugh that Pat always hated to hear other women use, the laugh that diminished possibilities. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too late. You&#x2019;d be amazed how much I&#x2019;ve done since I was your age, how much difference I&#x2019;ve made. You can do whatever you want to, make yourself whatever you want to be.&#x201d; <br>The nurse recoiled a little from her vehemence. &#x201c;Calm down now, Patricia,&#x201d; the male nurse said on her other side. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re scaring poor Nasreen.&#x201d; <br>She grimaced. Men always diminished her that way, and what she had been saying had been important. She turned back to the female nurse, but they were out of the lift and in a corridor she&#x2019;d never seen before, a corridor with heather-twill carpet, and though she had been sure they were going to the podiatrist it was an opthalmologist who was waiting in the sunny little room. <i>Confused,</i> she thought. Confused again, and maybe she really was scaring the nurses. Her mother had scared her. She hated to close herself back in the box of being a good girl, to appease, to smile, to let go of the fierce caring that had been so much a part of who she was. But she didn&#x2019;t want to terrify people either. <br>Later, back in her bedroom with a prescription for new reading glasses that the nurse had taken away safely, she tried to remember what she had been thinking about Pamela. Follow your heart, she had said, or perhaps follow your art. Of course Pamela hadn&#x2019;t been famous then, and there had been nothing to mark her as destined for fame. She&#x2019;d been just another girl, one of the hundreds or thousands of girls she had taught. Towards the end there had been boys too, after they went comprehensive, but it was the girls she especially remembered. Men had enough already; women were socialized not to put themselves first. She certainly had been. It was women who needed more of a hand making choices. <br>She had made choices. Thinking about that she felt the strange doubling, the contradictory memories, as if she had two histories that both led her to this point, this nursing home. She was confused, there was no question about that. She had lived a long life. They asked her how old she was and she said she was nearly ninety, because she couldn&#x2019;t remember whether she was eighty-eight or eighty-nine, and she couldn&#x2019;t remember if it was 2014 or 2015 either. She kept finding out and it kept slipping away. She was born in 1926, the year of the General Strike; she held on to that. That wasn&#x2019;t doubled. Her memories of childhood were solitary and fixed, clear and single as slides thrown on a screen. It must have happened later, whatever it was that caused it. At Oxford? After? There were no slides any more. Her grandchildren showed her photographs on their phones. They lived in a different world from the world where she had grown up. <br>A different world. She considered that for a moment. She had never cared for science fiction, though she had friends who did. She had read a children&#x2019;s book to the class once, Penelope Farmer&#x2019;s <i>Charlotte Sometimes,</i> about a girl in boarding school who woke up each day in a different time, forty years behind, changing places with another girl. She remembered they did each other&#x2019;s homework, which worked well enough except when it came to memorizing poetry. She had been forced to memorize just such reams of poetry by her mother, which had come in handy later. She was never at a loss for a quotation. She had probably been accepted into Oxford on her ability to quote, though of course it was the war, and the lack of young men had made it easier for women. <br>She had been to Oxford. Her memories there were not confusingly doubled. Tolkien had taught her Old English. She remembered him declaiming <i>Beowulf</i> at nine o&#x2019;clock on a Monday morning, coming into the room and putting the book down with a bang and turning to them all: &#x201c;Hwaet!&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t been famous then, either. It was years before <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and all the fuss. Later people had been so excited when she told them she had known him. You can never tell who&#x2019;s going to be famous. And at Oxford, as Margaret Drabble had written, everyone had the excitement of thinking they might be going to be someone famous. She had never imagined that she would be. But she had wondered about her friends, and certainly Mark. Poor Mark. <br>The indisputable fact was: she was confused. She lost track of her thoughts. She had difficulty remembering things. People told her things and she heard them and reacted and then forgot all about them. She had forgotten that Bethany had been signed by a record label. That she was just as delighted the second time Bethany told her didn&#x2019;t matter. Bethany had been crushed that she had forgotten. Worse, she had forgotten, unforgivably, that Jamie had been killed. She knew that Cathy was wounded that she could have forgotten, even though she had said that she wished she could forget herself. Cathy was so easily hurt, and she wouldn&#x2019;t have hurt her for anything, especially after such a loss, but she had, unthinkingly, because her brain wouldn&#x2019;t hold the memory. How much else had she forgotten and then not even remembered that she had forgotten? <br>Her brain couldn&#x2019;t be trusted. Now she imagined that she was living in two different realities, drifting between them; but it must be her brain that was at fault, like a computer with a virus that made some sectors inaccessible and others impossible to write to. That had been Rhodri&#x2019;s metaphor. Rhodri was one of the few people who would talk to her about her dementia as a problem, a problem with potential fixes and workarounds. She hadn&#x2019;t seen him for too long. Perhaps he was busy. Or perhaps she had been in the other world, the world where he didn&#x2019;t exist. <br>She picked up a book. She had given up on trying to read new books, though it broke her heart. She couldn&#x2019;t find where she had put them down and she couldn&#x2019;t remember what she had read so far. She could still re-read old books like old friends, though she knew that too would go; before the end her mother had forgotten how to read. For now, while she could, she read a lot of poetry, a lot of classics. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s <i>Cranford</i> came to her hand now, and she opened it at random to read about Miss Matty and her financial difficulties back in the time of King William. &#x201c;The last gigot in England had been seen in Cranford, and seen without a smile.&#x201d; <br>After a while she let the book drop. It had grown dark outside, and she got up and tottered over to draw the curtains. She made her way carefully, hanging onto the bed and then the wall. They didn&#x2019;t like her to do it without the quad cane but she was safe enough, there wasn&#x2019;t room to fall. Though she had fallen once on her way to the toilet and forgotten that she had a button to call for help. The curtains were navy blue, although she was quite sure there had been a pale green blind the last time. She leaned on the window sill, looking out at the bare branches of a sycamore moving in the breeze. The moon was half-obscured by a thin veil of cloud. Where was this place? Up on the moor? Or was it somewhere along the canal? There might be birds in the branches in the morning. She must remember to come and look. She had her binoculars somewhere. She remembered insisting on holding on to them and Philip saying gently that she wouldn&#x2019;t have any use for them in the nursing home and Jinny saying in her gruff way that she might as well bring them if she wanted them. They must be here somewhere, unless that was in the other world. It would be very unfair if the binoculars were in one world and the tree were in the other. <br>If there were two worlds. <br>If there were two worlds, then what caused her to slide between them? They weren&#x2019;t two times as they were for Charlotte. It was the same year, whichever year it was. It was just that things were different, things that shouldn&#x2019;t have been different. She had four children, or three. There was a lift in the nursing home, or there was only a stairlift. She could remember things that couldn&#x2019;t simultaneously be true. She remembered Kennedy being assassinated and she remembered him declining to run again after the Cuban missile exchange. They couldn&#x2019;t both have happened, yet she remembered them both happening. Had she made a choice that could have gone two ways and thereafter had two lives? Two lives that both began in Twickenham in 1926 and both ended here in this nursing home in 2014 or 2015, whichever it was? <br>She shuffled back and looked at her notes, clipped to the end of the bed. It was February 5th 2015, and she was VC. That was definite, and good to know. She sat down but did not take up the book. It woul...</p><h2>The Road to Home: My Life and Times</h2><p>Vartan Gregorian&#39;s tale starts with a childhood of poverty, deprivation, and enchantment in the Armenian quarter of Tabriz, Iran. As the world reeled from depression into six years of warfare, his mother died, leaving his grandmother Voski as the loving staff of his life. Through unlettered example and instruction, he learned about the first of his many worlds: the strenuousness required for survival, the fairy tale that explained existence, the place and name of his own star in the night sky, how to maneuver as a member of a Christian minority in a benevolent Muslim kingdom, the beauty and inspiration of Armenian Church liturgy, the exciting foreign world of ten-year-old American westerns, the richness of life on the streets. He learned the magic of the innumerable worlds he could find in books -- and he wanted to visit them all. As the spell books cast on him grew more powerful, so did the constraints imposed by his father&#39;s indifference to his dreams of redirecting his life through learning. So, one day when he was fifteen years old, he presented himself at an Armenian-French lyc�e in Beirut, Lebanon, to start the arduous task of becoming a person of learning and consequence. This book tells not only how he reached that school but also about the many people who guided, supported, taught, and helped him on an extravagantly absorbing and varied journey from Tabriz to Beirut to Palo Alto to Tenafly to London, from Stanford University to San Francisco State University to the University of Texas at Austin to the University of Pennsylvania to the New York Public Library to Brown University and, currently, to the presidency of Carnegie Corporation of New York. With witty stories and memorable encounters, Dr. Gregorian describes his public and private lives as one education after another. He has written a love story about life.</p><p>Vartan Gregorian previously served as president of Brown University and as president of the New York Public Library.<p><b>CHAPTER FIVE: To America</b></p> <p> On August 3, 1956, I landed at New York's Idlewild (now JFK) Airport. The flight was long and exhausting and I was anxious. Once again, I was facing the unknown for I really did not know much about the United States. What little I knew was through the prism of Hollywood. My English, to be charitable, was shaky. I was afraid not only of embarrassing myself in America but also the Coll�ge Arm�nien and its considerable investment in me. I was scared to let down Sir, not to mention the Armenian communities of Tabriz and Beirut -- indeed, the entire Armenian nation and my fatherland, Iran, and of course Mr. Vratzian. Like many shy, frightened immigrants, I was too proud to ask questions lest they unmask my ignorance. I pretended to know everything. Behind the fa�ade of my self-assurance, there was a profound fear. </p><p> My first test came during my flight from Paris to New York. I was handed a U.S. Customs declaration form. Prior to the flight, I had been given an inventory form by Pan American Airways, to help me make a record of my belongings. I thought there must be a certain connection between the two forms, and therefore I listed everything in my possession in order to satisfy U.S. Customs. I wanted to be both accurate and thorough. After all, I was coming to the "land of laws," of "complete transparency" and "accountability." </p><p> After filling in the Customs form ("no purchases, nothing to declare") on a separate sheet of blank paper, I listed the number of socks, evening shirts (I thought any shirt you wore during the evenings was an evening shirt), T-shirts, underwear, handkerchiefs, as well as shoes, gloves, suits, and jackets. I had two or three silver frames. I did not know the word "frame." I asked a passenger across the aisle about it. She told me they were "frames." I heard her say "frabes." So I listed them as "frabes." I am sure the bewildered Customs officer must have thought I was a nut and threw my "inventory" into the garbage can. </p><p> As we approached America, my anxiety gained sadness as a companion. Upon the death of my mother, when I was six and a half years old, my younger sister and I were told by our relatives that our mother had gone to America: "a distant but beautiful land." As we were approaching that "beautiful land," my childhood fantasy that my mother was in America came to an abrupt and sad end. I had to catch up with the reality of death. </p><p> The dream of going to America had been a fantasy. For me, America itself was a fantasy built and rebuilt in my mind and psyche. I had lived it through scores of cowboy movies. My American heroes, who embodied courage, honor, loyalty, solidarity, integrity, self-sacrifice, patriotism, love of justice, and generosity, had prepared me for a fantasyland and sustained my dreams. </p><p> None of the movies prepared me for my first encounter with New York. I was stunned, overwhelmed, intoxicated, "blown away" by it. It was huge, massive, powerful. The varieties of sounds, colors, shades dazzled me. I had never seen or imagined so many cars, buses, ambulances, so many fire engines, police cars, taxis, or so many people in one city! The multitudes, their energy, their fast pace were incredible. All of a sudden, I felt I was in the presence of a microcosm of all humanity, the whole world. Every ethnic group, religion, race, continent was in New York. I had never seen so many tall buildings. Nor had I seen a concentration of so much cement, concrete and, especially, steel and iron. For the first time, I saw water towers and long fire escapes. They seemed to be everywhere. Elevators, escalators, and revolving doors impressed me, as did the number of shops and restaurants, not to mention the multitude of well-dressed people. I got lost in Central Park. It was so huge that I thought it contained all the trees and all the gardens of Tabriz, Tehran, and Beirut combined. </p><p> One Sunday, I visited Saint Patrick's Cathedral. It was imposing, majestic, yet open and welcoming. The burning candles, the beautiful music, interspersed with moments of silence and serenity, had a soothing effect on me. The altar boys reminded me of my childhood in Tabriz and my church, where I had spent so many Sundays hearing of and singing for the glory of God. All of a sudden, I felt very sad and nostalgic. My childhood seemed remote. </p><p> The sight of the Central Post Office of New York City on Eighth Avenue and 34th Street astonished me. It was a civic monument, rather than a mere post office. It symbolized stability, confidence, and durability. I read with great pride the words inscribed on the lofty entrance: <i>Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.</i> The quotation, adapted from the Greek historian Herodotus, refers to couriers of the Persian Empire who, in the sixth century b.c., could travel some 1,600 miles in one week. </p><p> The Brooklyn Bridge fascinated me. I had never seen such a major, long bridge in my life. It was so powerful and graceful and beautiful! Speaking of beauty and grace, imagine my utter disbelief and enchantment when I saw Mar�a F�lix, the actress, on Fifth Avenue. I became paralyzed. For a moment, I felt I was in Hollywood! I could not wait to write my friends that I had seen the personification of beauty. </p><p> The opulence of Fifth, Madison, and Park Avenues did justice to my Hollywood vision of America. Broadway and Times Square stunned me; I had never thought it was possible for a city not to sleep, or to have so much entertainment, so many bars, theaters, so many nightclubs, so much nudity, so many stations of sin and fantasy. But most impressive of all, I had never imagined seeing so much light and electricity in a single city. I felt as if the entire electric supply of the world was centered in New York, making it the City of Light. These firsthand, fast-moving impressions made me imagine New York as the City of Cities, the embodiment of power and sheer energy. I wrote to my sister that New York was a gigantic magnet. It attracted everything and everyone in the world, every source of power, energy, and scrap metal and every creative idea. </p><p> I had seen the Empire State Building in the movie <i>King Kong,</i> but nothing prepared me for the experience. I felt as if I were on the top of the world. After observing the range and the depth of the city, its architectural and engineering wonders, I wrote home that in New York I felt like an anonymous ant. If they stepped on me, I wrote, they would not even notice me. "This city will humble anyone and teach everyone humility," I wrote, adding that in New York, while you may be insignificant, at the same time you are just like anybody else, alone yet part of the multitude. </p><p> I had brought two letters of introduction from Mr. Vratzian. One was to Edward (Eddy) Sahakian, president of the Broadway-based Pictorial Engraving Company, Ltd., and the other to Martiros Zarifian, director of auxiliary services of the Taft Hotel. Eddy Sahakian was a benefactor of the Coll�ge Arm�nien. I had lunch with Mr. Sahakian. Mr. Zarifian took me to his home on Long Island. </p><p> The reception accorded me by the two Armenian-Americans whom I had never met made me realize the range of all diasporas -- whether Jewish, Chinese, Indian, Greek, Lebanese, Irish, Egyptian, Nigerian, Italian, Portuguese, Armenian, Turkish, Kurdish, or Pakistani. I had always thought of diasporas as limited and parochial. In New York, later in California, I discovered that I was utterly wrong. Diasporas tend to be cosmopolitan, international. In any distant region, country, or city, one has an instant link to one's diaspora through one's extended, dispersed family, one's religion, cultural institutions, language, press and, of course, commerce. An immigrant, a student, a visitor finds an easy foothold, a pathway, a bridge to a foreign country. </p><p> After bidding farewell to the Zarifians on Long Island, I went to Idlewild to catch my flight to San Francisco. I had sent a wire to those who were instructed by Mr. Vratzian to meet me at San Francisco Airport. I was placed on a waiting list. I did not know that there were more than one or two flights a day from New York to San Francisco, nor did I know that there were several other airlines that had scheduled flights. My message stated that I was arriving in San Francisco on such and such a date with Trans World Airlines. </p><p> Then the worst possible thing happened. I lost my airline ticket. I told the ticket agent who had wait-listed me about my "tragedy." "What can I do?" I asked. "Not much," he said. "You have to declare the loss, wait for a certain period of time, and file a claim." "I can't do that," I replied. "Don't you understand? I have to be in San Francisco tomorrow! I must register as a freshman at Stanford University this week. I am desperate, desperate, desperate!" I actually <i>shouted</i> at him. Tears of anger, self-pity, and shame and my horrified face must have touched him. He told me, "I have never done what I am about to do. I will stamp this empty envelope, marked <i>New York to San Francisco,</i> without a ticket in it. You can board the plane. But you must stay onboard all the way. Do not disembark. Stay on it until you get to San Francisco." Grateful, yet fearful, I boarded the midnight plane. The fourteen-hour flight stopped in Chicago, Kansas City, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, before arriving in San Francisco. At each stop, I told the stewardess that I did not feel well and would rather stay aboard. The generosity of the airline clerk had an impact on me. Even in New York, this massive metropolis, individuals mattered. After all, I was not an insignificant, anonymous ant. </p><p> I loved San Francisco. It was one of the most spectacular cities I had ever seen, even in the movies. It was beautiful, open, warm, hospitable, charming, and manageable. You were not overwhelmed by it, you were won over. I felt welcome. Once again, I could see the sky and the stars. In some ways, it reminded me of Beirut and its charm.

Dan Lenson</p><p>David Poyer's naval career has included service in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Arctic, Caribbean, and Pacific. His seventeen novels have won millions of readers around the world, and his sea fiction is required reading in the Literature of the Sea course at the U.S. Naval Academy. <i>The Med</i> is the first in his novel-cycle of the modern Navy, which also includes <i>The Gulf</i>, <i>The Circle</i>, <i>The Passage</i> and<i> Tomahawk</i>. He lives in Virginia with his wife and daughter.<br>In the mold of such novels as From Here to Eternity and the recent Time and Tide, this is a powerful story, as honest as it is imaginative, about a joint Navy-Marine task force on a mission to rescue a large group of American and British hostages being held in Syria by Palestinian terrorists. The plot revolves around a few key characters, each in the grip of crises both personal and relevant to the fate of the mission. Among the well-delineated principals are the force commander, a jittery, careerist commodore unworthy of his rank; a naval lieutenant trying to live down a tragic past mistake; a chief engineer who figures in a wonderfully vivid engine-room drama; a sensitive, guitar-playing black who feels out of place in the Marines; the lieutenant's wife, who is among the hostages; and the terrorist leader, ruthless yet with a certain charisma. The commodore's inadequacies jeopardize the Marine assault that is the story's exciting climax. Readers will be gripped by the impression that these are real men in a realistic, and indeed uncomfortably topical, situation. Poyer is a former Navy officer. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men</h2><p>The author who aroused a storm of debate with Who Stole Feminism? takes sexual politics to a new level in a book that demonstrates how feminist ideals and politically correct practices are putting American boys at risk.</p><p>Richard Bernstein &#34;The New York Times&#34; The burden of [this] thoughtful, provocative book is that it is American boys who are in trouble, not girls.

Finkelstein's</b> eleventh nonfiction book for young readers. "Like all parents," Finkelstein says, "I enjoyed telling my children how much better life was when I was their age. The idea for <i>The Way Things Never Were</i> emerged when they began challenging my heroic tales of walking fifteen miles to school in waist-deep snow." <p> Finkelstein is a school librarian for the Brookline, Massachusetts, public school system and a part-time instructor at Hebrew College. Among his titles are <i>Remember Not to Forget: A Memory of the Holocaust; Theodor Herzl: Architect of a Nation; The Emperor General: A Biography of Douglas MacArthur; Sounds in the Air: The Golden Age of Radio; Thirteen Days/Ninety Miles: The Cuban Missile Crisis; With Heroic Truth: The Life of Edward R. Murrow; Heeding the Call: Jewish Voices in America's Civil Rights Struggle;</i> and <i>Friends Indeed: The Special Relationship Between Israel and the United States.</i> Norman Finkelstein lives in Framingham, Massachusetts.</p>The catchy title of Finkelstein's (Friends Indeed) latest is a bit of a misnomer, for his examination of the good old days of the 1950s and '60s spends less time debunking myths of the past than extolling the superiority of present-day America. In his prologue, Finkelstein notes that current talk-show hosts and politicians "tell us how much happier we would be if only we returned to the values, lifestyle, and practices of America's past." But the social and cultural issues of primary concern to those espousing "family values" garner little attention here. The majority of the chapters open with a nostalgic "myth" (e.g., "We Never Locked Our Doors"; "We Respected Our Elders"), followed by a discussion of advancements in technology and government programs which make life in the 1990s better than it was in the past. Some of Finkelstein's points are unsurprising (polio vaccines and the widespread use of antibiotics have led to a far healthier population) while others seem more like claims than facts (e.g, he asserts there was more violence on TV in the past than there is today). Quotations from Finkelstein and others who were children during the 50's and 60's enliven a statistic-filled text, as do the book's many historical photographs and perky design (though lengthy photo captions printed in tiny type are a drawback). For those readers up to the challenge, Stephanie Coontz's book for adults, The Way We Never Were, gives a more provocative examination of this glorified era. Ages 10-14.

It concludes that the more distinction is embraced, the closer a man and woman become. Thus gender, rightly understood, is a tool for intimacy. Written in a compassionate tone and winsome style, the volume speaks to Christians who want to know what the Bible says about gender differences and why. This theology of gender is also of value for people who struggle with same-sex attraction but want to follow Christ.</p><p>Sam A.

Weary of endless rehearsals and performances, Amy sets out on a road trip through the Pennsylvania mountains. She leaves her cell phone behind so life&#39;s demands can&#39;t intrude on her solitude. She doesn&#39;t know, nor care, where she will end up.When her car breaks down deep in the mountains, Amy realizes the flaw in her &#34;no cell phone&#34; plan. She abandons her car and walks the winding roads, searching for help. Following the smell of woodsmoke and the sound of music, she finds a rustic log cabin. There she meets a young Amishman--and through him a community--that will change her life forever.</p><p>Come home to Hickory Hollow, Pennsylvania--the beloved setting where Beverly Lewis's celebrated Amish novels began--with new characters and new stories of drama, romance, and the ties that draw people together.<br><br>A wrong turn in a rainstorm leads Englisher Amelia Devries to Michael Hostetler--and the young Amishman's charming Old Order community of Hickory Hollow. Despite their very different backgrounds, Amelia and Michael both feel hemmed in by the expectations of others and struggle with how to find room for their own hopes. And what first seems to be a chance encounter might just change their lives forever.<br><br>"Lewis's presentation of Amish life portrays the advantages and disadvantages of a community with definite rules and a solidarity that can be both enviable and constraining. The musical motifs offer welcome variation on very familiar Amish themes that Lewis renders in virtuoso style. This opens the Home to Hickory Hollow series, but stands alone nicely." --Publishers WeeklyI studied my reflection in the mirror over the sink. Clean-shaven...blond hair cropped just below my ears, with the usual old-fashioned bangs. I looked like all the other young Amishmen I knew. And it made me feel even more lost.<br><br>Deserting the mirror, I went to kneel beside one of the bunks in the main room. "Hear my prayer for guidance, O God," I whispered, feeling guilty as I was reminded of my disobedience to the wishes of my parents. Could I expect my prayers to reach past the ceiling?<br><br>A single gas lantern brightened the gloom. There was really no need for the lantern when the cabin had electricity, but having my old lantern from home reminded me of the very thing that had brought me to this momentous day. Because I knew full well if I continued to walk the fence, I might end up on the other side--the outside, looking in.</p><h2>The Mennonites</h2><p>Originating in Europe in the sixteenth century, the Mennonites are a Protestant religious sect, related to the Amish. Rather than compromise their way of life they have continually been forced to migrate around the world to maintain their freedom to live as they choose. The greatest number of them are now to be found in Mexico, and many also live or regularly migrate to work in rural Canada.<br>Magnum photographer Larry Towell first encountered the Mennonites near his home in Ontario, Canada, and his friendship with them has gained him unique access to their communities. He has been photographing Mennonites in Canada and Mexico for over ten years, creating a unique and intimate portrait of their way of life. In addition, Towell's own fascinating text tells us in poignant and descriptive detail of his experiences. With an artist's eye he paints a picture of their lives: the harshness and poverty of their rural existence, the disciplines and contradictions of their religion, their hunger for land and for work, and the constant struggle to keep the modern world at bay.</p><p>The work of Larry Towell (b.1953) is based on intimacy. His photographs of the Nicaraguan contra war, the &#39;disappeared&#39; of Guatemala, US Vietnam veterans and Palestine, as well as those of his own family, all demonstrate an acutely personal relationship with his subjects which is underpinned by his beautiful prose.

These images, appearing together here for the first time in print, constitute an amazing body of photojournalism created under the most adverse circumstances imaginable. As this book reveals, however, they are far more than visual reportage; they also are images of great artistry that capture the life-and-death drama that was played out against an arctic landscape of magnificent and terrible beauty. </p><p> The story told here through Frank Hurley's lens began in the summer of 1914, when Shackleton and his crew set sail from England with the intention of being the first to cross Antarctica from one coast to the other, passing through the South Pole on the way. After five months they reached the freezing Weddell Sea and were within sight of land when the Endurance became trapped in the ice pack. Nine months later, the ship was finally crushed, leaving the crew stranded on drifting ice floes at the end of the earth. </p><p> What followed is one of the most remarkable survival stories in the history of human exploration. Shackleton's men camped on the ice floes for five months before they escaped in their lifeboats and, after a harrowing five-day voyage, reached Elephant Island, a barren outcrop too remote for any hope of rescue. From there, Shackleton and five other volunteers set out for South Georgia Island and miraculously reached their destination after traversing 850 miles of the fiercest seas on the face of the planet in an open lifeboat. There they raised help, and three months later, after three failed attempts, Shackleton made it back to Elephant Island with a rescue ship. </p><p> Incredibly, every single one of his men survived. Almost as incredible is the fact that so much of this drama was captured on film by Frank Hurley, and that so many of these pictures survived. South with Endurance is the first book to reproduce a total of nearly 500 extant photographs, including many remarkable color images that have never been published before. It is also the first to reproduce the photos to a standard and size that display Hurley's work as the art that it is. Drawn from the archives of the Royal Geographical Society in London, the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney, and the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, the photographs are complemented by excerpts from Hurley's diary, a chapter about the expedition itself, a biographical essay, and commentary about Hurley's photographic techniques.</p></p><p><b>Frank Hurley</b> was born in Australia in 1885. He ran away from home at age thirteen. Hurley worked in an ironworks and at the Telegraph Department before becoming a photographer. In 1911, he joined Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic expedition, which he documented with stills and a film entitled <i>Home of the Blizzard.</i> Upon his return from Shackleton's 1914-1917 expedition, Hurley went on to serve Australia as an official photographer in both world wars; returned to the Antarctic as a filmmaker with Mawson in 1929; and made many more documentary and fiction films that confirmed his reputation as Australia's greatest photographer by the time of his death, in 1962.The story of Sir Earnest Shackleton's harrowing 1914 Antarctic expedition has been told many times in Shackleton's own account, in a PBS series and in a recent book focusing on the leadership lessons his journey taught, just to name a few. But in South with Endurance: Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition 1914-1917, The Photographs of Frank Hurley, an oversized collection featuring all of the official photographer's pictures (including several previously unpublished color plates), the voyage continues to enthrall. The stark black and white images of the ship and its men caught in an ocean of ice are both beautiful and chilling; photography buffs and adventure lovers alike will relish the images from one who was surely one of history's greatest documentary photographers. 500 photos in duotone and color. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Hollywood Doesn&#39;t Live Here Anymore</h2><p>The second volume of film-maker Robert Parrish&#39;s memoirs, following on from &#34;Growing Up in Hollywood&#34;, it is a collection of anecdotes about the ups and downs of making movies.

Ra's Al Ghul has miraculously returned from what was thought to be a fiery demise. His features badly burned, Ra's needs a completely new host body to continue his evil ways. His candidate is bratty Damian-his grandson, who happens to be the child of Batman and Talia, Ra's Al Ghul's daughter. When Damian is eventually captured by his grandfather, Batman and Ra's face off to determine the boy's fate. The artwork varies with each chapter. Violence is depicted, and images of women may strike some as objectification. The exaggerated, comic-book-style illustrations are consistently well done, although characters are rendered differently by each artist, a fact that may throw off some readers. The writing also fluctuates with each chapter, from standard heroic platitudes to tongue-in-cheek sarcasm. This is not an essential purchase, but it will be welcomed by readers with knowledge of the characters and backstory.&#x2014;<i>Travis Jonker, Dorr Elementary School, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What makes this story so special is its commitment to making recent scientific discovery accessible to children. Although the dinosaurs are personified, the fictionalization never becomes maudlin; while obviously directed at children, the story maintains a realistic viewpoint towards birth, life, and death. Exquisite color illustrations back Horner's theories by representing dinosaurs in a clear, anatomically realistic manner. Fossil evidence indicates that Maiasaura did raise their young in nests and were attentive parents. Other information, such as Maiasaura coloration or noise-making abilities, are more a matter of conjecture. The authors have filled the gaps of knowledge believably, although problems may arise when readers try to differentiate between fact and fiction. Personification such as ``Maia felt happy'' also detracts from an otherwise objective stance. Horner notes that it's impossible to hypothesize without taking the chance of being wrong, and that science could not progress if scientists were unwilling to constantly rethink and revise. That Horner and Gorman have chosen to share this process with children makes this an especially important book, despite its flaws. Cathryn A.

We&#x2019;re reaching down <i>under</i> that barrel.&#x201d; He leaned over and gave Brown, his old workmate, a blow where a corporal&#x2019;s stripes still graced a sleeve. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t that right, boys?&#x201d; <br>Scattered on stumps and scavenged chairs set out in the wonderful sun, the old comrades drew their pipes from their mouths to offer up mock dismay at the coming promotion. Recruits new to the company smiled cautiously. <br>Apple blossoms feathered down around them. Promotion or not, Corporal Charles Brown told himself, the world went on, and the war went on, and one man no longer counted for very much. Yet, he was pleased by the prospect of adding a stripe. <br>&#x201c;Promoting Brownie ain&#x2019;t half so bad as making Doudle a corporal,&#x201d; Charlie Oswald, a corporal himself, declared. &#x201c;I predict complete defeat for the Union in no time at all. Short rations a-coming, boys, Andersonville&#x2019;s a-calling.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nothing to laugh about,&#x201d; Doudle said. &#x201c;Andersonville, I mean.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you do agree it&#x2019;s a grave&nbsp;&#x2026; a grave and desperate measure&nbsp;&#x2026; making you a corporal and Brownie there a sergeant,&#x201d; Wildermuth insisted. He cackled and tapped the ashes from his pipe. &#x201c;I fear for the glorious Union, boys,&#x201d; he told the new recruits. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be crying for your mothers, if they ain&#x2019;t crying for you. Between Brownie, Doudle, and U. S. Grant, it&#x2019;s a-going to be something.&#x201d; <br>A quiet man, solid as oak, Private Henry Hill startled them all. Not only by speaking, but by the force in his tone: &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s &#x2018;making&#x2019; Corporal Brown a sergeant. He made himself a sergeant. And you know it.&#x201d; <br>Hill meant well. He always did. But solemnity wasn&#x2019;t in season. A mood as fine as the afternoon&#x2014;all green and gold and blue and free of rain&#x2014;had captivated the men. The teasing continued amid the drifting blossoms. <br>Wildermuth stretched like a sun-warmed cat and turned back to the new faces. All of the gathered soldiers, green or veteran, had been canal boatmen back home. Except for Sammy Martz, the Pottsville blacksmith, who could not be deterred from joining their fellowship. <br>&#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; Wildermuth resumed, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s hard enough for a man to tell you four Eckerts apart. I mean, I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;re brothers, cousins, uncles, or everything at once. Fellow gets to wondering what all goes on back home on Eckert Hill. Tell you this, though: Private Hill there might be the first sergeant&#x2019;s confessed and proven cousin, but him and Brownie got some relation they ain&#x2019;t admitting. Can&#x2019;t hardly separate &#x2019;em, can&#x2019;t hardly tell &#x2019;em apart. Same great big inky-head targets for the Johnnies, same jut-out jaws just a-begging for a fist.&#x201d; He stretched again, smiling as if he knew all and would soon tell all. &#x201c;Only difference I see is that Henry there got black eyes fit for a gypsy gal. Which sets a man wondering in a new direction entirely.&#x201d; <br>Thrilled by spring, two birds swooped overhead. Delighted to have an audience still unwise, Wildermuth went on: &#x201c;I figure it&#x2019;s all up with us now. Over and done. You new fellows joined up at a terrible time, just terrible. Before you know it, &#x2018;Sergeant&#x2019; Brown&#x2019;s going to be running the company, if not the regiment. Then you look out! Yes, sir! General Burnside himself won&#x2019;t be able to save a man among you.&#x201d; <br>Surfeited, Brown spoke for himself at last: &#x201c;Bill, if words were bullets, we could point you south and there wouldn&#x2019;t be one Reb left alive come Sunday. And First Sergeant Hill might have something to say about who runs the company.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not for long,&#x201d; Wildermuth said. &#x201c;I hear they&#x2019;re going to make him a lieutenant any time now. And lieutenants never do nothing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d make a good officer,&#x201d; Doudle said. &#x201c;What say, Henry? Pair of shoulder straps for Cousin Willie?&#x201d; <br>Hill shrugged. His first loyalty, as all the veterans knew, was to the soon-to-be sergeant. Henry Hill and Charles Brown had not been close back home on the Schuylkill Canal, but war had bound them together in the odd way it had with men. <br>Sensing, as old soldiers do, that the call to form up was coming, Brown rose and said, &#x201c;You Eckerts. You there, Martz. Line up, let me have a look at you. I&#x2019;m not going to have you embarrassing this company.&#x201d; <br>The new men fumbled about, but got themselves into what passed for order. Brown was struck, yet again, by how young they appeared. There would be, at most, two or three years&#x2019; difference between the survivors of old Company C and the new recruits they&#x2019;d collected during their reenlistment furlough in February. Yet, the men who had left their barges and mule barns in &#x2019;61, who had fought from Port Royal to Knoxville, looked a decade older to Brown&#x2019;s eyes. <br>He thought of his elder brother, dead of a simple sickness and buried at Vicksburg, above a river whose breadth stunned men bred on the humble Schuylkill. The regiment had moved from north to south to the west and back again, staking claims to strange earth with its dead. Now its flag drooped on a Virginia field. They had gone in a circle, blindfolded mules in a mill. <br>Flicking away a blossom that called to mind women and private things, Brown tightened the belt on one of the Eckert boys, asking, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re William, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Corporal. I&#x2019;m Johnny. That&#x2019;s William.&#x201d; Dutchie as could be, the new man pronounced the names as &#x201c;Chonny&#x201d; and &#x201c;Villy-yam.&#x201d; The Eckerts were their own breed. In more than one way, folks said. <br>Brown grunted. Of the four Eckerts in the company now, the only one he could be sure of naming right was Isaac, who had been with them from the beginning. Standing off to the side, Isaac Eckert did not take a protective or helpful attitude toward his relatives, but let Brown straighten them out. <br>&#x201c;I have a thing I must ask you, please, Corporal Brown,&#x201d; the next Eckert in line said. His accent was thick as lard on farmhouse bread. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Them Rebel girls, the ones in town there?&#x201d; <i>Dem Reppel kirlz, ta wuns in tawn dare?</i> If Brown sometimes had trouble understanding the speech of Reb prisoners, he was sure the Johnnies wouldn&#x2019;t know what to make of the Eckert boys or the other Dutchmen in the 50th Pennsylvania. <br>&#x201c;What about &#x2019;em?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They are all so <i>verdammt</i> mean? I try to make polite&nbsp;&#x2026; but when I lifts my cap, <i>die kleine Hexe</i> looks like I am the snake and she wants for the hatchet.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The ladies of Warrenton have seen their fill of Yankees,&#x201d; Brown told the boy. He thought about the matter for a moment. &#x201c;You just do like I told you and stay away from those darkey gals who come around of evenings. Or you&#x2019;ll go home with something you won&#x2019;t be proud of.&#x201d; <br>Henry Hill spoke again. Twice in an afternoon was something of a milestone. <br>&#x201c;First sergeant just stepped out of the captain&#x2019;s tent.&#x201d; <br>He spoke to Brown as if no one else were present. <br>&#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; Brown said to the new men, straining to remember his canal Dutch. &#x201c;Try to look like soldiers out there. <i>Stramm und still, versteh&#x2019;? Mach doch keine Schweinerei.</i> And keep a crimp in your knees, the way I told you. Any man passes out in front of Captain Burket, he&#x2019;ll have guard duty for a month. Let&#x2019;s go now. <i>Los geht&#x2019;s.</i>&#x201d; <br>Company C of the 50th Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment had not gone in for an excess of pomp of late, but the captain wanted to put martial spirit into the new recruits, to make them feel part of something big and important. So the day&#x2019;s two promotions, which otherwise would have been handled in five minutes by the first sergeant, would occur in front of a company formation. <br>Good day for it, anyway, Brown thought. It looked as though they might have a dry stretch. Virginia had put on her best green dress, decorated with pink and purple blossoms, thick with scents that put hopes in a man. This field of tents just north of Warrenton&#x2014;a hard Rebel town, if ever a hard one there was&#x2014;had almost a fairground atmosphere, crowded with men as thoughtless as bees in the warmth. Yet, every man who had a campaign behind him sensed that they would march to battle soon, knowing it the way veteran soldiers just knew, sensing that this fellow Grant was out to get an early start on the season, that General Burnside and their Ninth Corps were about to be swept along behind the Army of the Potomac. The veterans knew the awfulness of it, too, the pain and death that waited, yet good sense could not overcome their excitement at the prospect of marching forward, of heading southward one more time, of <i>doing</i> something. If war made men of boys, it could also make boys of men. <br>Charles Brown had long ago stopped trying to make sense of war. He had listened for years as his fellow soldiers, his fellow canal men, complained endlessly about army life, the folly of generals, the bad food and poor equipment, the marches to nowhere. They claimed, endlessly, that they&#x2019;d give anything to go home, and to Hell with the war. Nonetheless, the survivors of Company C had reenlisted almost to a man. War was a woman you hated but couldn&#x2019;t let go. <br>All of the high-flown purposes were gone now. There was only the rough ache to win that they all shared, and the being together like this, the queer feeling when faced with death that even those who survived would never be so completely alive again. Men learned to treasure the smell of campfire coffee and a shared tobacco pouch. A soldier repaired another fellow&#x2019;s boot and made a friend who would die for him. If he lived&#x2014;and Brown hoped to&#x2014;he knew he would never be able to explain it. <br>He had not chased promotions and looked down on those who did. Yet, men had always turned to him for orders, back on the canal and then at war. In barely twenty-three years of life, he had been forced to lead in countless ways, starting back when he was just a boy. So he did his part, and a little more, and tried not to lament what he could not change. <br>Thinking about the great, big things led nowhere. The regiment had been camped right here in 1862, below the defiant town up on the hill. Now they were back again. And what difference had all the bleeding and dying made? The young darkies who had not run off expected less these days, although they still flattered, begged, cajoled, and stole, while the older Negroes just kept at their doings. You saw them leaving their shanties in the dawn, shuffling up to the fine brick houses to start the stoves and fireplaces, just as they had been doing all their lives. As for the white women of the sort who had startled that Eckert boy, their once fine dresses were faded now, but they carried themselves as high and mighty as ever. If anything, they&#x2019;d grown haughtier. Except for the destruction and the slaughter, Brown was not sure that very much had changed. Or ever would. <br>It had been jarring to go home for a month. It was good, because it was home, but unsettling because home had changed. After Knoxville, the regiment had endured its worst experience of the war, not a battle but a winter march through the mountains into Kentucky. Knoxville had been a horror of wicked cold and savage fighting with frozen hands and feet, but the worst came afterward, when the regiment, shy of winter garments and shoes, had been issued nothing but uncured hides in which to wrap their feet for a march of two hundred miles. The footwear they stitched and tied together had hardly lasted a day, and the regiment had left bloody tracks on the snow. Had the men of Company C not reenlisted the autumn before, the number who would have signed on again might have been a sight lower after that march. <br>But ordeals end for the lucky men who survive them. They had been fitted out again, then carried home in railroad cars. After the ravaged Southland, it was a shock to see the prosperity of the North. When their train pulled into Schuylkill Haven, the men were amazed at the furious work behind the <i>Turnverein</i> band and the hollering families. Boats and barges jammed the canal basin, all but blocking the channel, and new construction had risen wherever there was dry land along the river. The rail yards, sprawling over the Flats, seemed greater now than those of a Southern city. In many ways, the war had been good to the town at the bends of the Schuylkill, with the Navy&#x2019;s hunger for anthracite coal and industries begging for it. Schuylkill Haven was the point where the coal region ended and barges were filled for the trip to Philadelphia. It had always seemed a busy place, but never frenzied like this. <br>There was money for those who had not gone to war. <br>But there was a price, too. There were more rough-mannered Irishmen now, taking over the shacks on the Eck, where Brown had passed a brief and broken childhood. Louts in packs roamed Dock Street in the evenings, and sullen women in shawls cursed at Dutch grocers. The new men on the canal were surly, anticipating accusations that they belonged in uniform themselves. Unasked, they loudly damned the war and the nigger, in brogues as foreign as their red and ready faces, willing to fight in any saloon, but not on a field of battle. It grated on Brown to see the lack of care they took with the boats and their even worse care of the mules. It bothered him more than it had a right to do to see busy towpaths left in disrepair and the brass fittings at the harbormaster&#x2019;s station left unpolished. When Captain Burket had been harbormaster before the war, each last buckle on a mule&#x2019;s belly had shone. Now it felt as though nothing mattered but making money today, tomorrow be damned. The town was home, and it wasn&#x2019;t. <br>Yet, for all the rawness and brute collisions between the Dutch and Irish, home still had a decency Brown missed in the South. Here, in Virginia, there were great houses and shanties, with little between them. In Schuylkill Haven there wasn&#x2019;t one building as grand as the plantation house down the field or the mansions behind the courthouse on Warrenton Hill. Back home, men lived in a world more evened out, with due respect given but no sense that one fellow was a king and his neighbors dirt. They were different worlds, North and South, and Brown wondered, as he had often done, if they belonged together. <br>On the last fair day back home&#x2014;kind weather for early March&#x2014;he and Frances had fled her family for the orchard west of the river, seeking an hour of privacy amid trees months shy of flowering, and he had felt they understood each other. He was good enough with words with other men, but women wanted something more, and he was not sure that he possessed that something. Frances didn&#x2019;t seem to mind. She just smiled. Her presence beside him on that bright day had been thoroughly, wonderfully good. He had wanted, terribly, to ask her to marry him then. But he held back. The war had made widows enough. Nor did he want her to be a cripple&#x2019;s nurse. He would ask when the war was over, if he returned a whole man. It was the only decent course he saw. And if Charles Brown no longer believed in high and mighty causes, he had come to believe in decency all the more. <br>For now, he labored over letters to her, conscious of his defective spelling and wishing, for her sake, that he had more education. Most of what he had learned he had taught himself, at the cost of candles sold three for a penny, the sort that smoked and stank. He had been sent out, a small boy, to work in a tobacco factory for twenty-five cents a week, by a miserly father afraid to end up in an almshouse. The Lord&#x2019;s own joke, his father had died of cholera, without telling even his wife where he hid his money. <br>Laboring at the stacks and racks had been hateful work, its only lasting effect ...</p><h2>History of the Idea of Progress</h2><p>The idea of progress from the Enlightenment to postmodernism is still very much with us. In intellectual discourse, journals, popular magazines, and radio and talk shows, the debate between those who are &#34;progressivists&#34; and those who are &#34;declinists&#34; is as spirited as it was in the late seventeenth century. In History of the Idea of Progress, Robert Nisbet traces the idea of progress from its origins in Greek, Roman, and medieval civilizations to modern times. It is a masterful frame of reference for understanding the present world. Nisbet asserts there are two fundamental building blocks necessary to Western doctrines of human advancement: the idea of growth, and the idea of necessity. He sees Christianity as a key element in both secular and spiritual evolution, for it conveys all the ingredients of the modern idea of progress: the advancement of the human race in time, a single time frame for all the peoples and epochs of the past and present, the conception of time as linear, and the envisagement of the future as having a Utopian end. In his new introduction, Nisbet shows why the idea of progress remains of critical importance to studies of social evolution and natural history. He provides a contemporary basis for many disciplines, including sociology, economics, philosophy, religion, politics, and science. History of the Idea of Progress continues to be a major resource for scholars in all these areas.</p><p></p><h2>Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men</h2><p>By carefully examining the biological, genetic, evolutionary, and psychological evidence, a noted biologist finds a shocking lack of substance behind ideas about biologically based sex differences. Features a new chapter and afterward on recent biological breakthroughs.</p><p><b>Anne Fausto-Sterling</b> is professor of biology and medicine at Brown University.Are men smarter than women, better at math, inherently more aggressive? Are women verbal, subject to monthly emotional storms, and doomed without hormone intervention to a sexless deteriorating old age? Do studies by sociobiologists shed light on gender behavior in humans? Fausto-Sterling, an associate professor of medical science at Brown University, considers all these questions, concentrating on the scientific studies on which popular assumptions are often based. She presents complicated ideas clearly and knowledgeably and is devastatingly critical of the scientific validity of much of the work she cites. Her own opinions unavoidably (and admittedly) color her judgment subtly, but she does great service in exposing the faultiness of many gender studies and presenting the complexity of this important topic.

This text is newly updated and corrected in a complete and combined printing. 702 pages including appendix. This volume is the first of what will be finally a four volume set of The Book of Remembrance that is prophesied in Malachi 3:16. The first two volumes are now in print - the second volume being The Book of Remembrance of Enoch. This volume is an interpretation of the Judgement Tablet. It is an account of ancient people, beginning at the time of the Flood and continuing on through the life of Christ, and concluding with prophecies beyond our own day. It contains the first eye witness account of the Last Judgment. It is a book for those serious about their inquiry into the nature of God.</p><p>These two volumes are great. It is difficult to summarize because there is soooo much here...but I&#39;ll try because I want people to know about this book. 1) The first half of the book is about the 24 holy communities throughout the course of the earth. It tells about 21 communities in the past and the tasks they accomplished for God and 3 in the future and what they will do for Him. The appendix has a great chart (which I reference all the time) on the Watchers. The chart gives the names of the Watchers and their created natures or what feelings of God they manifest; so you can better identify what you feel with the wind, or a tree, etc. 2) the second half of the book is less narrative and more theological - discussing topics like repentance, obedience, Christ&#39;s advocacy for each human being. I think my favorite part is the detailed description of the creation of the earth and each human soul. It blows out of the water all concepts that would support racism or any other degrading ideas which separate people because it shows clearly how the earth was created for each and every individual one of us - in our uniqueness. It&#39;s by far the best part of the book for me. I also got a lot out of the description of the Final Judgement and the compassion expressed by Christ for even those who are wicked. Very moving narrative. This book has a lot of great material and can be read over and over and over again. I highly recommend it. --S. Smith</p><h2>Trials of Death (Cirque Du Freak: Saga of Darren Shan, #5)</h2><p>The trials: seventeen ways to die unless the luck of the vampire is with you. Darren Shan must pass five fearsome Trials to prove himself to the vampire clan ? or face the stakes of the Hall of Death. But Vampire Mountain holds hidden threats. Sinister, potent forces are gathering in the darkness. In this nightmarish world of bloodshed and betrayal, death may be a blessing...</p><p>Darren Shan was born in London but at an early age he moved to Limerick, Ireland, with his parents and younger brother. He grew up watching old Dracula horror movies and reading spooky comics, which were the inspirations for this series. Trials of Death is his fifth novel in The Saga of Darren Shan.<br>Grade 4-7-This is the fifth novel in the continuing saga of the youthful half-vampire assistant to Larten Crepsley, a full vampire. Crepsley has brought Darren to Vampire Mountain to undergo the Trials of Death, an elective ritual periodically undergone by vampires in order to bond with the clan and prove their worth. As a half-vampire, Darren is in more danger of failing the trials than the others who usually participate, but he is determined to go ahead. The penalty for failing without dying is execution. In the background a new conflict looms, involving the vampaneze, purple-skinned killers who resemble vampires but who are nothing like the beings whom Darren has come to respect and admire. When it appears that he will not survive the trials, his vampire friends urge him to escape. Escorting him out through the mountain's underground tunnels, they run smack into an incoming vampaneze invasion. In the final pages, the plot and action finally pick up to fever pace as Darren is caught between invaders, defenders, and possibly a traitor in the ranks of the faithful. Characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the plot plods along until the final conflict heats up the action. Although the story stands on its own, there isn't much reason to read this one aside from following the series.<br><i>Susan L.

This striking book provides the answers.</b> <br> <br>A hat designer, Punk musician, sculptor, fireman, professional rent-a-Buddha, heavyweight boxer, peace movement worker, gourmet chef, United Nations official, dog trainer, chiropractor, sanitation worker, Marine Corps pilot, tire retreader-these and many more: 184 men and women with only one thing in common. They are bald. Unmasked, void of make-up and shorn of hair, stripped of civilized disguise, what does a human face say? And how does it make us feel? Avant-garde photographer Alex Kayser launches us on an odyssey into the emotionally charged topography of the human countenance. Kayser shares the story of his work in a delightfully candid conversation, and National Book Award winner Richard Howard provides a brilliant and provocative afterword.<br></p><p><b>Alex Kayser's</b> previous books include <i>Artists Portraits</i>; his photographs have been published in numerous magazines, including <i>Geo, Fortune, </i>and <i>Esquire.</i> <br><b>Alex Kayser: A Conversation with Lyn Mandelbaum and Alan Axelrod</b> <br> <br>LM: This book consists of one photograph, you said?<br> <br>AK: Yes, 184 times the same picture. Only the faces change. There is a different person in every shot.<br> <br>LM: Why doesn't anyone have hair?<br> <br>AK: Some of them have no hair naturally, but most of them shave their heads daily.<br> <br>AA: What in the world started you off on a project of photographing bald people?<br> <br>AK: This book isn't about baldness. It has nothing to do with bald people. It has to do with faces, exposed faces. I wanted to eliminate hair in this series in order to deal solely with physiognomy. Hair would have been quite distracting.<br> <br>LM: It really works. As a viewer, you go directly into the face, and you get lost in its features. This guy is great. Who is he?<br> <br>AK: He's the vice president of a big steel company, and the one down here is the fourteen-year-old singer of a New Wave band. The people photographed come from just about every walk of life.<br> <br>LM: This book is all headshots. Amazing. I never saw anything this sharp, this clear before.<br> <br>AK: I tried to do an honest, straight series, not faking anything, not flattering, but analytic, if you like.<br> <br>LM: For me, what makes the pictures so attractive is their directness. You get totally taken in by the subject. Its almost impossible to escape. But why isn't anybody smiling?<br> <br>AK: Why isn't Michelangelo's David smiling? I tried to do physiognomy studies rather than portraits, which is why I tried to give them all the same neutral expression. Some of my naturally happy models I would ask to stop smiling. Others again I would try to relax. And many would sit down and be just right.<br> <br>AA: You have enforced such uniformity, headshots framed exactly the same way, shot from the same angle with the same light, all the models without hair. They seem to be identical at first glance, because of their equal abstract quality.<br> <br>AK: They were designed to work in a group, and not so much as individual pictures. Their identical design was necessary, much as bricks have to be the same size to build a house. If every picture element that you can control is the same, the differences are solely in the faces. Thats why the individual physiognomy and character come through so strongly.<br> <br>AA: How did you find all these people?<br> <br>AK: Some I saw on television or in the <i>New York Times.</i> Others I met in the street, at a club, or restaurant. One day, looking through my window, I noticed this nice guy, he's a sanitation man. He was down there with his huge truck, picking up garbage across the street. My assistant ran down after him to say hello and tell him about our project.<br> <br>LM: What did he say?<br> <br>AK: He was delighted with the idea of being photographed and came to the studio a few days later during his lunch break. But most of the people in <i>Heads</i> I did not discover myself. My friends and all the other people who frequent my studio during the week always had the greatest ideas and suggestions. They would go: "Oh, you should get my neighbor from the third floor." Or, "My hairdresser has such a beautiful head." And, "You have to get the lawyer of my company." Everybody seemed to know somebody he thought was just right for the series, and I was really amazed to find people so enthusiastic, almost passionate to contribute something to that work. Without them, this book would not be here.<br> <br>LM: Did you photograph everyone who was sent to you?<br> <br>AK: Yes. The only requirement was that they have no hair. For the rest, I felt quite comfortable with Warhol&#x2019;s "everything is beautiful" principle. So I worked with everybody who was recommended to me, and one day I ended up having 250 pictures.<br> <br>LM: Are they all going to be in the book?<br> <br>AK: I hoped they would be, but then we had to cut the number down to 184 to make the book work.<br> <br>AA: How did you decide, then, who was going to be in the book?<br> <br>AK: This was simply a mathematical decision, and not an aesthetic or even personal one. It was hard, though, since these pictures are all the same in any of their qualities. I felt like I wanted to pick and choose with closed eyes.<br> <br>LM: But, as an artist and photographer, didn&#x2019;t you get bored doing the same kind of shot over and over again?<br> <br>AK: One would think so, but I could still do more. Originally, I had planned to do a series of twelve, maybe twenty heads. But then the response I got from people, their suggestions and introductions, was so overwhelming that I just went on with it. Also, since I was making groups out of the individual pictures, I would always need another particular face to match the one of Duane, Bill, or Annie. Or I was waiting for another black guy with a big beard. Each of the models brought his or her own aura into the picture. So, somehow, when I put the groups together, these different auras became like different colors when you paint or different spices when you cook. Depending on how they are put together, each group turns out to have a very specific feeling of its own. I went on and on. Even when this work started to become routine--and the shooting itself took only ten minutes meeting with this incredible variety of people remained enormously interesting. Some days you had to be up very early to receive a Wall Street broker at 8 a.m. So, over a small breakfast, you would hear some news from the stock market. Then at 9 a.m. you would shoot this yoga teacher, who has to be out by 10, because he is teaching an 11:30 class at Rikers Island prison. At 3 p.m. a rock musician would show up, playing you a cassette of his groups latest concert, commenting on his work. At 4 you would have an inspector from the New York City Health Department, a man who inspects hospitals. He is very kind and modest and at first does not quite know why I would ask him to model for me. Then at 5 p.m. the actor Harve Presnell, already with some make up on for tonight&#x2019;s show (or for me?), would tell me about what it was like playing Daddy Warbucks in Broadway&#x2019;s <i>Annie</i> 1,600 times <br></p><h2>New Directions in Altered Books</h2><p>New Directions in Altered Books</p><p></p><h2>See Inside: Houses Long Ago</h2><p>A fabulous flap book for older children showing the houses built by people around the world in different historical eras.

"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet" . . . "Search me, O God, and know my heart" . . . Such phrases leap to mind each time a Christian lifts his or her heart to God. For many, in fact, the book of Psalms is the richest part of the Old Testament. Renowned scholar Derek Kidner provides a fresh and penetrating guide to Psalms 73-150. As in the companion volume (<em>Psalms 1-72</em>), he analyzes each psalm in depth, comments on interpretive questions and lays bare the universal relevance of the texts. This helpful companion to the book of Psalms, while not specifically devotional, will inspire and deepen personal worship. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series. These commentaries are designed to help the reader of the Bible understand what the text says and what it means. The Introduction to each book gives a concise but thorough treatment of its authorship, date, original setting and purpose. Following a structural Analysis, the Commentary takes the book section by section, drawing out its main themes, and also comments on individual verses and problems of interpretation. Additional Notes provide fuller discussion of particular difficulties. The goal throughout is to explain the true meaning of the Bible and make its message plain.</p><p>The works of Derek Kidner (MA, Christ's College, Cambridge) are full of the marks of both professor and pastor with his even�handed scholarship as well as his devotional insight. These qualities have made his commentaries in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series and The Bible Speaks Today series some of the most beloved and popular of recent decades. Kidner had a long career in both the church and the academy in England. He studied at Cambridge University and then served in the ministry for several years before becoming a senior tutor at Oak Hill Theological College. Kidner began his writing career while serving as warden of Tyndale House in Cambridge from 1964 to 1978, publishing his ninth and final book, <em>The Message of Jeremiah,</em> in 1987.</p><h2>Athanasius Kircher: A Renaissance Man and the Quest for Lost Knowledge</h2><p>With 105 illustrations.

In the surreally delightful novel <i>Wise Children</i>, an elderly woman recounts the colorful life she and her identical twin sister led as vaudeville performers. And the early story collection <i>Fireworks</i> reveals Carter taking her first forays into the fantastical writing that was to become her unforgettable legacy. As critic Laura Miller has argued, "Most contemporary literary fiction with a touch of magic owes something to Angela Carter's trailblazing." This Everyman's Library omnibus gathers the best of Angela Carter in one astonishing volume.</p><p>ANGELA CARTER (1940-1992) was an English novelist, short story writer, and journalist. She wrote nine novels and numerous short stories, as well as nonfiction, radio plays, and the screenplay for Neil Jordan's 1984 movie <i>The Company of Wolves</i>, based on her story of the same name. Carter won numerous literary awards, traveled and taught widely in the United States, and lived in London.from the Introduction by Joan Acocella<br><br>The English novelist Angela Carter is best known for her 1979 book &#x201c;The Bloody Chamber,&#x201d; which is a kind of modernization of the classic European fairy tales.&nbsp; This does not mean that Carter&#x2019;s Little Red Riding Hood chews gum or rides a motorcycle but that the strange things in those tales &#x2013; the werewolves and snow maidens, the spider-hung caves and liquefying mirrors &#x2013; are made to live again by means of a prose informed by the wonders of cinema and psychoanalysis and Symbolist poetry.&nbsp; In Carter&#x2019;s &#x201c;Beauty and the Beast,&#x201d; retitled &#x201c;The Tiger&#x2019;s Bride,&#x201d; the beast doesn&#x2019;t change into a beauty.&nbsp; The beauty is changed into a beast, a beautiful one, by means of one of the more memorable sex acts in twentieth-century fiction.&nbsp; At the end of the tale, the heroine is ushered, naked, into the beast&#x2019;s chamber.&nbsp; He paces back and forth:<br> &nbsp;<br><i>"I squatted on the wet straw and stretched out my hand.&nbsp; I was now within the field of force of his golden eyes.&nbsp; He growled at the back of his throat, lowered his head, sank on to his forepaws, snarled, showed me his red gullet, his yellow teeth.&nbsp; I never moved.&nbsp; He snuffed the air, as if to smell my fear; he could not.</i><br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slowly, slowly he began to drag his heavy, gleaming weight across the floor towards me. </i><br><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tremendous throbbing, as of the engine that makes the earth turn, filled the little room; he had begun to purr. . . . </i><br><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dragged himself closer and closer to me, until I felt the harsh velvet of his head against my hand, then a tongue, abrasive as sandpaper.&nbsp; &#x201c;He will lick the skin off me!&#x201d;</i><br><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each stroke of his tongue ripped off skin after successive skin, all the skins of a life in the world, and left behind a nascent patina of shiny hairs.&nbsp; My earrings turned back to water and trickled down my shoulders; I shrugged the drops off my beautiful fur."</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine that: a great, warm, wet, abrasive tongue licking off skin after skin, down to the bottommost skin, which then sprouts shiny little hairs.&nbsp; <br><br>Because Carter took on fairy tales, and also because she favored a outr� look &#x2013; she liked long, flowing skirts and in her late years sported a great, disorderly mane of grey hair (Andrew Motion said she looked like &#x201c;someone who&#x2019;d been left out in a hurricane&#x201d;) -- she was sometimes slotted as a &#x201c;white witch,&#x201d; the sort of person who reads Tarot cards and believes that the earth speaks to her.&nbsp; Therefore it was good to see Edmond Gordon, in his &#x201c;The Invention of Angela Carter&#x201d; (Oxford), the first full-scale biography of the writer, reclaim her from the fairy kingdom and place her within what sounds like a real life.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, we find out that the white witch cared about her advances and sales and reviews. <br> &nbsp;<br> Carter was born in 1940 and grew up in a quiet, middle-class suburb of London, the second child of a strait-laced mother, Olive &#x2013; she turned off the TV if a divorced actor came on the screen &#x2013; and a father, Hugh, who was the night editor of London&#x2019;s Press Association. &nbsp;Both parents spoiled Angela outrageously.&nbsp; She was crammed with treats, bombarded with kittens and story books. Her mother never put her to bed until after midnight, when Hugh got back from work &#x2013; she wanted her company -- and even then, the child was often allowed to stay up.&nbsp; Hugh brought home long rolls of white paper from the office for her, and as her parents chatted, she wrote stories in crayon. <br><br>She grew to be a tall, pudgy child, with a stammer.&nbsp; Between those disadvantages and extreme shyness, which she covered with a frosty manner, she had few friends. &nbsp;Olive redoubled her attentions.&nbsp; Angela was not allowed to dress herself, or to go to the bathroom alone. &nbsp;Finally, she rebelled, went on a diet, and changed from a fat, obliging girl to skinny, rude girl.&nbsp; She slouched around in short skirts and fishnet stockings, smoking and saying offensive things to her mother. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>She was a good student, though.&nbsp; The 1944 Butler Act, riding the same democratic wave as the American G. I. Bill, provided grants for gifted children from regular backgrounds to go to elite private schools. &nbsp;Carter, as an adult, had a theory that the Butler Act created Britain&#x2019;s first real intelligentsia, a group of people who had no interest in using education to maintain the class system but who simply wanted to operate in a world of ideas.&nbsp; If so, she was one of them.&nbsp; She went to a demanding school, Streatham Hill &amp; Clapham High, and did well in the subjects she cared about, above all English and French. (Her French teacher loaned her a record of a Com�die Fran�aise actor reading Baudelaire and Rimbaud, and thereby made her a linguistic high-flyer for life.) Her teachers urged her to apply to Oxford. &nbsp;Olive, hearing that, pronounced it an excellent idea and said that she and Hugh would take an apartment in Oxford to be close to her. &nbsp;Angela thereupon dropped all thought of going to university.&nbsp; Marriage, she realized, would be her only way of escaping her parents. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through her father&#x2019;s connections, she got a job as a reporter, and soon, while working on a story about the new folk music movement &#x2013; this was now the late fifties -- she met a serious-minded young man, Paul Carter, an industrial chemist who moonlighted as a producer and seller of English folk-song records. &nbsp;Paul was apparently the first man to take a romantic interest in Angela.&nbsp; Or, as she put it, &#x201c;I finally bumped into somebody who would . . . have sexual intercourse with me.&#x201d; &nbsp;But Paul insisted that they be engaged first, and so Angela found herself, at twenty, a married woman.<br><br>They seem to have been happy at the beginning.&nbsp; Paul taught Angela to love English folk music and thereby gave her a great gift.&nbsp; The folk iconography, in time, would offer her an escape hatch from the rather grey realism dominant in the fiction of that period.&nbsp; Folklore also presented her with a set of emotions that, while releasing her, eventually, from sixties truculence, nevertheless felt true, not genteel. &#x201c;Few nations have spent quite as long as England in creating an official mask,&#x201d; she wrote in 1962:<br> &nbsp;<br><i>"What are we like?&nbsp; Oh, you know. Reserved. Imperturbable. Anti-romantic.&nbsp; Practical. . . . But study our folk heritage, our great and still living heritage of rough and ready poetry, and there is the authentic face.&nbsp; The man who emerges from English folk song is as merry as a cricket, as lecherous as a goat, a Gargantua in appetites and mirth, with a pulsing vein of lyric poetry in his body."</i><br> &nbsp;<br> This is somewhat cheerier than she would ever be, or than English folk song was.&nbsp; Still, it pointed her in a hopeful direction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But soon the marriage was failing.&nbsp; Paul was subject to engulfing depressions.&nbsp; Sometimes he and Angela barely spoke for days.&nbsp; She felt swollen with unexpressed emotion.&nbsp; &#x201c;I want to touch him all the time, with my hands &amp; my mouth,&#x201d; she wrote in her diary. &#x201c;(Poor luv, it annoys him.)&#x201d; &nbsp;The note of sarcasm here is interesting.&nbsp; Through some miracle, Angela, who had little sexual self-confidence &#x2013; she once described herself as &#x201c;a great, lumpy, butch cow, . . . titless and broadbeamed&#x201d; &#x2013; did not allow Paul&#x2019;s withdrawal to demoralize her.&nbsp; She wanted to save herself.&nbsp; On her twenty-second birthday, her Uncle Cecil, knowing that she was unhappy, invited her to lunch at an Italian restaurant and told her to apply to university.&nbsp; As she recalled, he said to her, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got a degree you can always get a job.&nbsp; You can leave your husband any time you want.&#x201d; &nbsp;<br><br>She took his advice.&nbsp; The couple had recently moved to Bristol, for Paul&#x2019;s work, and she enrolled in the university there, studying English.&nbsp; The Bristol department was not an ideal situation for her, because, like many English departments in mid-twentieth century Britain, it was dominated by the principles of F. R. Leavis, who was intent on rescuing English fiction&#x2019;s &#x201c;great tradition&#x201d; from the showy, the sentimental, and the bizarre.&nbsp; Carter, who called Leavis&#x2019;s followers the &#x201c;eat up your broccoli&#x201d; school of criticism, managed to hide out in medieval studies, which she loved.&nbsp; She also encountered Freud, whose writings gave her a quasi-scientific support for the world of shock, dream, and eros that she now saw as the realm of art.&nbsp; Within a few years, too, she became enamored with the Surrealists and learned to feel, like them, that the goal of art was not truth, as the Leavisites would have it, but the marvelous, or that the marvelous was the truth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>All of this fed into her developing feminism.&nbsp; She was to become an ardent feminist, but not an orthodox one.&nbsp; Her main concern was not with women&#x2019;s being granted justice; she hated the idea of put-upon, suffering women and implied that they had it coming, by being such weaklings.&nbsp; What she wanted for women was that they should seize what they needed &#x2013; power, freedom, sex &#x2013; and she saw no fundamental difference between men and women that should prevent women from having those things.&nbsp; To use the current language, gender, to her, was a social construction.&nbsp; As she wrote to a friend, <br> &nbsp;<br><i>"Somebody asked me who my favorite women writers were the other day, meaning, I guess, some kind of writers who expressed a specifically feminine sensibility &#x2013; I said Emily Bronte, who&#x2019;s pure butch, and cursed myself afterwards because the greatest feminine writer who&#x2019;s ever lived is Dostoevsky, followed closely by Herman Melville. . . . And D. H. Lawrence is infinitely more feminine than Jane Austen, if one is talking about these qualities of sensitivity, vulnerability and perception traditionally ascribed by male critics to female novelists. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; D. H. Lawrence&#x2019;s tragedy is that he thought he was a man."</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t know what she means about Dostoevsky, but her general statement should sound familiar in our day of fluid gender definitions.<br><br>Energized by her discoveries, she became a bustling presence in her department and the co-editor of its literary magazine.&nbsp; In this stapled-together publication the best items were the poems of one Rankin Crowe, which turned out to be a nom de plume for Angela Carter.&nbsp; (It is a misspelled version of the name of a cowboy whose self-published 1970 memoir, &#x201c;Rankin Crow and the Oregon County,&#x201d; she must have read.&nbsp; She liked cowboys.&nbsp; She went to see Sergio Leone westerns.) &nbsp;Especially striking is a poem called &#x201c;Unicorn.&#x201d;&nbsp; In the Middle Ages there was a belief that the only way to catch a unicorn was to send a virgin, alone, into the woods.&nbsp; The unicorn, spying the girl, would come and lay his head in her lap.&nbsp; Such a virgin is the speaker in Carter&#x2019;s poem, but she is not a tender little thing. She is naked, with breasts &#x201c;like carrier bags&#x201d; and &#x201c;curious plantations of pubic hair.&#x201d;&nbsp; The unicorn is drawn to her by &#x201c;the fragrance of her moist / garden plot.&#x201d;&nbsp; He will be sorry.&nbsp; &#x201c;I have sharp teeth inside my mouth,&#x201d; she says.&nbsp; &#x201c;Inside my dark red lips.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>At the same time, Carter was producing the first novels that she would be willing to publish.&nbsp; She wrote at a furious speed, turning out narratives of violence that were sometimes layered with comedy, sometimes not.&nbsp; In &#x201c;Shadow Dance&#x201d; (1966), her first novel, a man named Honeybuzzard carves up the face of an annoyingly virtuous girl, Ghislaine.&nbsp; (After she gets out of the hospital he finishes the job, strangling her and leaving her naked corpse in an attic.) A year after that came &#x201c;The Magic Toyshop,&#x201d; in which the orphaned heroine is sent to live with her uncle, a sadistic puppeteer. In one scene he forces her to play Leda to a mechanical swan. &nbsp;Her next two efforts were in a similar vein.&nbsp; There are excellent things in all these books, but there is also a strong suggestion that Carter is still trying to drive her mother crazy.&nbsp; Even when the material is not shocking, the treatment is often self-indulgent.&nbsp; An editor once forwarded to her a reader&#x2019;s report describing a novel of hers as &#x201c;a queer little book.&#x201d; Carter, always lovably forthright, replied that the person who wrote that &#x201c;put her finger on my weakest spot, which is a tendency to a batty kind of whimsicality.&#x201d; &nbsp;She said she was sure she would work out some satisfactory solution.<br><br>She did.&nbsp; In 1969, Carter received a Somerset Maugham Award, worth five hundred pounds, to be used for foreign travel.&nbsp; She decided that she would grant herself an old wish, to go to Japan.&nbsp; Paul stayed home.&nbsp; &#x201c;I arrived by air, in the dark,&#x201d; she wrote.&nbsp; &#x201c;When night descended over the ocean, many unfamiliar stars sprang out in the sky; as we approached land, there began to blossom below me such an irregular confusion of small lights it was difficult to be certain if the starry sky lay above or below me.&nbsp; So the airplane ascended or descended into an electric city where nothing was what it seemed at first and I was absolutely confused.&#x201d; &nbsp;I see her there, dizzy, suspended between two blankets of light.&nbsp; It is like a conversion experience, and, writing two years after the event, she surely knew that.</p><h2>Colonels Brotherhood War</h2><p>This fourth volume in the &#34;Brotherhood of War&#34; series begins in America, where two professional soldiers take on the establishment when they begin to train guerilla forces.

Amber demanded.</p> <p>"What is it?" Kimberly asked, standing right behind Amber, anxiously trying to look over her shoulder.</p> <p>Beth glanced up briefly at her fourteen-year-old niece and her niece's best friend. Until just seconds ago, the two had been talking a mile a minute, as they always did, agreeing that their friend Tammy was a bitch, being far too cruel to <i>her</i> best friend, Aubrey, who in turn came to Amber and Kimberly for friendship every time she was being dissed by Tammy. They weren't dissing anyone themselves, they had assured Beth, because they weren't saying anything they wouldn't say straight to Tammy's face.</p> <p>Beth loved the girls, loved being with them, and was touched to be the next best thing to a mother for Amber, who had lost her own as an infant. She was accustomed to listening to endless discussions on the hottest music, the hottest new shows and the hottest new movies&#x2014;and who did and didn't deserve to be in them, since the girls were both students at a magnet school for drama.</p> <p>The main topic on their hot list had recently become boys. On that subject, they could truly talk endlessly.</p> <p>But now their continual chatter had come to a dead stop.</p> <p>Kimberly had been the one to stub her toe on the unknown object.</p> <p>Amber had been the one to stoop down to look, then demand that her aunt come over.</p> <p>"Well?" Kim prodded. "Dig it up, Beth."</p> <p>"Um, I don't think I should," Beth said, biting her lower lip.</p> <p>It wasn't just a skull. She couldn't see it clearly, there was so much dirt and debris, but despite the fact that it was half hidden by tangled grasses and the sandy ground, she could see more than bone.</p> <p>There was still hair, Beth thought, her stomach churning.</p> <p>And even <i>tissue.</i></p> <p>She didn't want the girls seeing what they had discov-ered any more closely.</p> <p>Beth felt as if the blood in her veins had suddenly turned to ice. She didn't touch the skull; she carefully laid a palm frond over it, so she would recognize the spot when she returned to it. She wasn't about to dig anything up with the girls here.</p> <p>She dusted her hands and stood quickly, determined that they had to get back to her brother; who was busy setting up their campsite. They were going to have to radio the police, since cell phones didn't seem to work out here.</p> <p>A feeling of deep unease was beginning to ooze along her spine as vague recollections of a haunting news story flashed into her mind: <i>Molly and Ted Monoco, expert sailors, had seemed to vanish into thin air.</i></p> <p>The last place they'd actually been seen was Calliope Key, right where they were now.</p> <p>"Let's go get Ben," she suggested, trying not to sound as upset as she felt.</p> <p>"It's a skull, isn't it?" Amber demanded.</p> <p>She was a beautiful girl, tall and slender, with huge hazel eyes and long dark hair. The way she looked in a bathing suit&#x2014;a two-piece, but hardly a risqu� bikini&#x2014;was enough to draw the attention of boys who were much too old for her, at least in Beth's opinion. Kimberly was the opposite of Amber, a petite blonde with bright blue eyes, pretty as a picture.</p> <p>Sometimes the fact that she was in charge of two such attractive and impressionable girls seemed daunting. She knew she tended to be a worrywart, but the idea of any harm coming to the girls was, </p> <p>Okay! She was the adult here. In charge. And it was time to do something about that.</p> <p>But they were practically alone on an island with no phones, no cars, not a single luxury. A popular destina-tion for the local boat crowd, but distant and desolate.</p> <p>It was two to three hours back to Miami with the engine running, though Fort Lauderdale was closer, and it was hardly an hour to a few of the Bahamian islands.</p> <p>She inhaled and exhaled. Slowly.</p> <p>The human mind was amazing. Moments ago she had been delighted by the very remoteness of the island, pleased that there weren't any refreshment stands, auto-mobiles or modern appliances of any kind.</p> <p>But now, "Might be a skull," Beth admitted, and she forced a grin, lifting her hands. "And might not be," she lied. "Your dad isn't going to be happy about this, Amber, when he's been planning this vacation for so long, but&#x2014;"</p> <p>She broke off. She hadn't heard the sound of footsteps or even the rustle of foliage, but as she spoke, a man appeared.</p> <p>He had emerged from an overgrown trail through one of the thick hummocks of pines and palms that grew so profusely on the island.</p> <p>It was that elemental landscape that brought real boat people here, the lack of all the things that came with the real world.</p> <p>So why did his arrival feel so threatening?</p> <p>Trying to be rational with herself, she decided that he looked just right for the type of person who should be here. He had sandy hair and was deeply tanned. No, not just tanned but <i>bronzed</i>, with the kind of dyed-in-deep coloring that true boat people frequently seemed to acquire. He was in good shape, but not heavily muscled. He was in well-worn denim cutoffs, and his feet were clad in deck shoes, have spent plenty of time barefoot.</p> <p>Like a guy who belonged on a boat, cruising the out islands. One who knew what he was doing. One who would camp where there were no amenities.</p> <p>He also wore shades.</p> <p>Anyone would, she told herself. She had on sun-glasses, as did the girls. So why did his seem suspicious, dark and secretive.</p> <p>She needed to be reasonable, she told herself. She was only feeling this sudden wariness because she had just found a skull, and instinctive panic was setting in. It was odd how the psyche worked. Any other time, if she had run into someone else on the island, she would have been friendly.</p> <p>But she had just found a skull, and he reminded her of the unknown fate of Ted and Molly Monoco, who had been here, and then, </p> <p>Sailed into the sunset?</p> <p>An old friend had reported them missing when they hadn't radioed in, as they usually did.</p> <p>And she had just found a skull at their last known location.</p> <p>So she froze, just staring at the man.</p> <p>Amber, at fourteen, hadn't yet begun to think of personal danger in the current situation. Her father was a boat person, so she was accustomed to other boat people, and she was friendly when she met them. She wasn't stupid or naive, and she had been taught street smarts&#x2014;she went to school in downtown Miami, for one thing. She could be careful when she knew she should.</p> <p>Apparently that didn't seem to be now.</p> <p>Amber smiled at the stranger and said, "Hi." "Hi," he returned. "Hi," Kim said.</p> <p>Amber nudged Beth. "Um&#x2014;hi." "Keith Henson," the man said, and though she couldn't see his eyes, his shades were directed toward her. His face had good solid lines. Strong chin, high-set cheekbones. The voice was rich and deep.</p> <p>He should have been doing voice-overs for commer-cials or modeling.</p> <p>Hey, she mocked herself. Maybe that was what he<i> did </i>do.</p> <p>"I'm Amber Anderson," her niece volunteered. "This is Kim Smith, and that's my aunt Beth." She was obviously intrigued and went on to say, "We're camping here."</p> <p>"Maybe," Beth said quickly.</p> <p>Amber frowned. "Oh, come on! Just because&#x2014;"</p> <p>"How do you do, Mr. Henson," Beth said, cutting off her niece's words. She stepped forward quickly, away from their find. "Nice to meet you. Down here on vacation? Where are you from?"</p> <p>Oh, good, that was casual. A complete third degree in ten seconds or less.</p> <p>"Recent transplant, actually a bit of a roamer," he told her, smiling, offering her his hand. It was a fine hand. Long fingered, as bronzed as the rest of him, nails clipped and clean. Palm callused. He used his hands for work. He was a real sailor, definitely, or did some other kind of manual labor.</p> <p>She had the most bizarre thought that when she accepted his handshake, he would wrench her forward, and then his fingers would wind around her neck. The fear became so palpable that she almost screamed aloud to the girls to run.</p> <p>He took her hand briefly in a firm but not too powerful grip, then released it. "Amber, Kim," he said, and shook their hands as he spoke.</p> <p>"So are you folks are from the area?" he asked, and looked at the girls, smiling.Apparently he'd already written Beth off as a total flake.</p> <p>She slipped between the two girls, feeling her bulldog attitude coming on and setting an arm around each girl's shoulders.</p> <p>"Yep!" Amber said.</p> <p>"Well, kind of," Kim said.</p> <p>"I mean, we're not from the island we're standing on, but nearby," Amber said.</p> <p>Henson's smile deepened.</p> <p>Beth tried to breathe normally and told herself that she was watching far too many forensics shows on television. There was no reason to believe she had to protect the girls from this man.</p> <p>But no reason to trust him on sight, either. "Are you planning on camping on the island?" Beth asked. He waved a hand toward the sea. "I'm not sure yet. I'm with some friends, we're doing some diving, some fishing. We haven't decided whether we're in a camping mood or not."</p> <p>"Where are your friends?" Beth asked. A little sharply? she wondered. So much for being casual, able to easily escape a bad situation, if it should prove to be one.</p> <p>"At the moment I'm on my own."</p> <p>"I didn't see your dinghy," Beth said. "In fact, I didn't even notice another boat in the area."</p> <p>"It's there," he said, "the<i> Sea Serpent</i>." He cocked his head wryly. "My friend, Lee, who owns her, likes to think of himself as the brave, adventurous type. Did you sail out here on your own?"</p> <p>It might have been an innocent question, but not to Beth. Not at this moment.</p></p><h2>Sixth Grade Secrets</h2><p>When Laura Sibbie starts a club called Pig City, she incites a near-war among her sixth-grade classmates and generates the creation of a rival club that has designs on Pig City&#39;s precious box of secrets.</p><p>Grade 4-6 Laura's below-the-waist hair and her spirited personality have earned her a leadership role among classmates and the secret worship of Gabriel. She starts a secret club called ``Pig City'' and begins a covert chalkboard writing campaign featuring ``pig'' words. In an effort to win Laura's attention, Gabriel sends a note, which jealous Sheila intercepts and changes. When Laura reads the now insulting letter, the battle begins. Eventually a rival club, Monkey Town, is formed. Warfare begins with silly pranks but soon escalates into ugly and destructive acts, culminating when Sheila and a friend sabotage Laura and cut her hair. The sheared Laura sees how foolish they've been, and the truth of Gabriel's affection comes to light. Laura's instant maturity may be a bit too rapid, given her stubbornness and intense pride, but overall, characters and their actions are realistic, uncomfortably so. The plot is predictable, and the writing style is just adequate, but the situations presented are on-target. The humor, frequent dialogue, and brief chapters make this suitable for reluctant readers.

It raises the crucial question of whether America could have won its independence without the aid of France. <br><br>The book begins with an overview of the intellectual and ideological contributions of the French Enlightenment thinkers, called the philosophes, to the American and French revolutions. It then moves to cover the many forms of aid provided by France to support America during the Revolutionary War. This ranged from the covert aid France supplied America before her official entry into the war, to the French outfitters and merchants who provided much-needed military supplies to the Americans. When the war began, the colonists thought the French would welcome an opportunity to retaliate and regain their country. France also provided naval assistance, particularly to the American privateers who harassed British shipping and contributed to the increased shipping rates which added to Great Britain's economic hardships. France's military involvement in the war was equally as important.<br><br>America's First Ally looks at the contributions of individual French officers and troops, arguing that America could not have won without them. Desmarais explores the international nature of a war which some people have called the first world war. When France and Spain entered the conflict, they fought the Crown forces in their respective areas of economic interest. In addition to the engagements in the Atlantic Ocean, along the American and European coasts and in the West Indies, there are accounts of action in India and the East Indies, South America and Africa.<br><br>Also included are accounts drawn from ships' logs, court and auction records, newspapers, letters, diaries, journals, and pension applications.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br>1: Covert Aid<br>2: Outfitters and Suppliers<br>3: Canada: The Fourteenth Colony<br>4: Naval Assistance<br>5: Military Aid<br>6: The West and East Indies<br>Epilogue</p><p>Norman Desmarais is Professor Emeritus at Providence College and an active reenactor.

Her husband is mostly absent, and, in 1929, her scandalous, beloved younger sister is one of the 42 killed in an explosion at the local dance hall. Who is to blame? Mobsters from St. Louis?

Based on a true story, this slim volume reimagines the horrific night when dozens were killed in a mysterious explosion at an Ozarks dance hall, the night "all hell came callin'." Years later, in the summer of 1965, our narrator's grandmother tells him her version of that night&#x2019;s events and, eventually, the boy&#x2019;s father encourages him, "Go on and tell it." The result is a story of hard times and hard people, of secrets, betrayals, and revenge. The murky, resilient truth of that night ripples across the family&#x2019;s future, unfolding on the page like a mash-up of Faulker, Flannery O'Connor, Johnny Cash, and the bible. This is an entirely original, brutal, and darkly elegant book, and Woodrell is a storyteller at the top of his game. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>Five of Daniel Woodrell's eight published novels were selected as <em>New York Times </em>Notable Books of the Year. <em>Tomato Red</em> won the PEN West Award for the Novel in 1999.

Every parent wants to provide nutritious and delicious things for their little ones to eat; the tricky part is deciding which foods are best and how to prepare them in a realistic amount of time. With so much conflicting nutrition info out there, parents can (and do) drive themselves bonkers, trying to make healthy choices.</p><p>By four to six months of age it is time to start introducing solids to your infant. From then on your goal should be to offer a wide variety of foods they will enjoy, while providing the nutrients they need to grow and thrive. However, many parents are often unsure of how to balance the right kinds of proteins, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and vitamins and minerals vital for proper growth and development. Plus, finding the time to prepare healthy meals can seem overwhelming, especially for new parents.</p><p>Recent nutrition research has found that most children fail to meet the recommendations for important nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, protein, fiber, and iron. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, less than 50 percent of toddlers ages two to three consume the recommended daily amount of fruits and veggies. More surprising is a 2012 survey of parents that found that most had never received advice on feeding their toddlers. This lack of knowledge can have long-term effects on young growing bodies and minds. A study published in October 2013 discovered that poor nutrition during the first five years might also lead to behavioral problems.</p><p>I created <i>First Bites</i> with health-conscious parents in mind. I hope you can use this book as a quick and easy reference guide that you can keep on hand to whip up tasty and nutritious meals in no time. Family-centric recipes featuring fifty astoundingly nutritious and delicious superfoods are designed to help foster healthy eating habits and create a diet filled with fresh, minimally processed foods that are just as delicious as they are healthy. In this book, fruit and veggies take center stage in new and exciting ways, yet you will also learn to create healthy spins on classic kid favorites like mac and cheese, pizza, chicken fingers, and cupcakes.</p><p>� WHAT&#x2019;S A SUPERFOOD? �</p><p>&#x201c;Superfood&#x201d; is an abused term. Some less reliable sources on nutrition lead people to believe that any food dubbed &#x201c;super&#x201d; is magical, and one bite will cure anything. My definition is much different. For a food to reach super status, it must be delicious, beautiful, unprocessed, and bursting with nutrients. Bananas and brown rice are obvious super choices, but exposing tiny palates to more unique foods like quinoa and bison also offers a plethora of good nutrition plus some exciting flavors and textures to explore. My list of fifty foods represents a well-rounded group that is affordable, easy to find, and filled with the nutrients that growing bodies need more of. Incorporating these whole foods into your household will help promote growth, energy, strength, and brain power.</p><p>In addition to the fifty superfoods, the recipes in this book are made with <i>real</i> foods&#x2014;each crafted with taste, nutrition, and palatability in mind. There are no artificial sweeteners or highly processed junk. I choose to use mostly natural sweeteners like honey and maple syrup but strongly believe that it is also OK to use regular old granulated sugar in moderation. Instead of chomping on candy and commercially baked goods in my house, we eat homemade frozen yogurt and cupcakes, made with a small amount of sugar.</p><p>There are two central themes of this book. First, a focus on the fifty superfoods, vibrant and exploding with flavor and nutrition. Second is a user-friendly guide (a handbook of sorts) for busy parents forever struggling to get healthy meals on the table.</p><p>To make this as effortless as possible, this book starts with a list of fifty foods along with a description of their nutrient content and health benefits. Each superfood listing also includes a list of the age-appropriate recipes where they are featured.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve also included my best tips for grocery shopping, meal planning, and must-have kitchen tools. Recipe chapters are organized by food group (fruits and vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy and eggs). Each chapter is further divided into age-appropriate sections&#x2014;six to twelve months, twelve to eighteen months, eighteen to twenty-four months, and two to three years to help parents make recipes that are best suited to the needs and preferences of their child as they grow. To wrap things up, the final chapter features menus for everything from family outings to weeknight playdates.</p><p>� NOTES FROM MY KITCHEN �</p><p>My kids aren&#x2019;t perfect eaters&#x2014;far from it! But a lifelong love of food and culinary training and an advanced degree in nutrition has led me to one conclusion about feeding kids: what is most important is spending time together in the kitchen as a family. I did not write this book to be the nutrition &#x201c;expert&#x201d; or guru but to share recipes that my family loves, and I hope yours will too.</p><p>There is a huge behavior component to the way that we eat. Our preferences begin to shape from the moment we are born and continue to develop with time and experience. Learning what we like and dislike is an ever-changing process. Parents should remember this, embrace it, and not fight it.</p><p>Raising healthy and happy eaters takes trial and error. It is a marathon (maybe even an Ironman), not a sprint. But hopefully, as your little ones grow to be not so little anymore, they will develop a healthy and happy relationship with food.</p><p>Like I said, my kids aren&#x2019;t perfect. They have their likes and dislikes, and even with all that I have learned, there are days when my husband and I break all the rules. No matter what, we always make the extra effort not to fight with them over food. To make the family table a positive experience even on the days when the kids are driving us up the wall. Between my two daughters I have almost seven years of experience feeding in &#x201c;the trenches.&#x201d; I used the same feeding strategies with both, and they could not be more different. One loves any and all fruits and vegetables and would literally eat them all day long. Meat, on the other hand, is not her favorite no matter how it is prepared. My other daughter is all about meat. From lamb chops to fish&#x2014;she always wants more. She is much more selective when it comes to veggies, with a small number of acceptable options on her list. They both loved eggs, then decided they hated them, then loved them again&#x2014;a roller coaster of drama, that&#x2019;s what little girls are made of in and out of the kitchen. There is one characteristic that they do share: they are (almost) always willing to try new things. They change every minute, and I embrace the excitement that comes along with their naturally dynamic nature.</p><p>In this book, I hope to share my knowledge, experience, and tips. I grew up loving food. From as early as I can remember I was sitting on the kitchen counter, observing, mixing, sprinkling, and learning from my parents. Taking it all in. My parents weren&#x2019;t chefs, but they both came from families who loved to cook. They instilled their love of food and cooking in my brother and me without even trying.</p><p>Since my days working and creating on the kitchen counter, my love of food has led to a career in nutrition, which has only further inspired my passion: carrying on the family tradition of sharing, appreciating, and loving delicious food. In a funny way I&#x2019;ve been preparing to write this book forever. These are the meals we eat in my house every day&#x2014;adults included! Family-centric, quick cooking that is never overly complicated. Fresh, easy, delicious, and healthy. The superfoods are our staple ingredients, and together the family explores the variety of these key foods. When my kids drag the step stool up to the counter yelling &#x201c;Can I help?&#x201d; it only motivates me to create more recipes that we can explore together. Some of these recipes will be hits, others will fail miserably, but I am proud that so far my girls love to cook and love to eat. They have an education about food and where it comes from. They easily identify superfoods, like butternut squash, kale, edamame, and quinoa. They are no strangers to the garden, and our local farmer is a rock star in their eyes. So as far as I&#x2019;m concerned, I&#x2019;m doing my job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>During the first three years, the rate of growth is more rapid than any other time in life. To support all this growth, kids need lots of nutrient-rich calories. The demand for vitamins and minerals is incredibly high, and some of these are easier to come by in the typical diet than others.</p><p>Dietary supplements may be an option for some children, but in general, food should always come first. Work with your pediatrician and a registered dietitian to determine your child&#x2019;s specific needs. Either way, make sure there are more of these five nutrients in their diet.</p><p>� CALCIUM �</p><p>Function</p><p>Calcium is responsible for the proper growth and development of teeth and bones as well as muscle contraction and nerve conductivity.</p><p>Needs</p><p>Children ages newborn to three require between 200 and 700 milligrams of calcium per day.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Calcium can be found in dairy products like milk (300 milligrams in one cup), cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. It is also added to some brands of orange juice, tofu, and breakfast cereals. Other sources include almonds, broccoli, and leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale.</p><p>Deficiency in Children</p><p>In severe cases calcium deficiency can cause weakened teeth and bones. Poor intake of calcium during childhood can affect bone health later in life, and when kids grow older they may be at greater risk for bone fractures and osteoporosis.</p><p>� VITAMIN D �</p><p>Function</p><p>The body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and mineralize bone. Vitamin D is also important for immunity and healthy muscles.</p><p>Needs</p><p>Vitamin D is measured in international units (IU). Children ages newborn to three require 400 to 600 IU per day.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Vitamin D is found in a relatively small number of foods, which may make it difficult for some kids to get enough. Mothers who exclusively breastfeed are encouraged to give babies vitamin D supplement drops during the first six to twelve months. From food it can be found in fatty fish (like salmon and tuna), egg yolks, and fortified foods like milk, orange juice, some cuts of pork, and some brands of yogurt. There are 40 IU in a glass of milk and about 20 IU in one egg yolk.</p><p>Humans are able to make some of their own vitamin D with the skin&#x2019;s exposure to sunlight, but production varies on where you live and the time of year. Since there are plenty of other good reasons to keep the kids out of the sun (and slather on the sunblock), focusing on food should be a priority.</p><p>Deficiency in Children</p><p>In children, a lack of vitamin D can cause rickets, a rare but serious condition where the bones become weak and pliable. Children who suffer from rickets often have impaired growth, malformed teeth, and bowed legs.</p><p>� OMEGA-3 FATS �</p><p>Function</p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are forms of healthy, polyunsaturated fats. They play an important role in circulation and neurological function. One form in particular, referred to as DHA, is beneficial for pregnant women, infants, and children, contributing to healthy skin, vision, neurological development, and cognitive function.</p><p>Needs</p><p>There are no established government recommendations for omega-3 intake for babies and children, but pediatricians recommend somewhere between 400 and 700 milligrams a day for infants and children ages newborn to three years.</p><p>Sources</p><p>In addition to prenatal vitamins, moms are encouraged to take omega-3 supplements from fish oil during pregnancy and for breastfeeding. As infants grow there are additional options to take in this important nutrient. Some brands of milk and many brands of infant formula have DHA added.</p><p>Fatty fish like salmon and tuna are wonderful sources of omega-3, but since these aren&#x2019;t the most popular food choices for many children, flaxseeds, walnuts (barring a nut allergy), egg yolks, and fortified foods like cereals, milk and yogurt, and some varieties of jarred baby foods also have DHA added.</p><p>Deficiency in Children</p><p>Kids who don&#x2019;t get enough omega-3 may be at a greater risk for learning deficits and possibly behavioral issues.</p><p>� IRON �</p><p>Function</p><p>Iron is one of the most important minerals for children and adults. It allows red blood cells to deliver oxygen to tissues and helps form enzymes that allow for all kinds of necessary body processes.</p><p>Needs</p><p>Requirements for iron shift with periods of growth. Children require 11 milligrams a day up to age twelve months, and then between ages one and three requirements decrease to 7 milligrams per day.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Iron can be found in plant-based foods like beans, raisins, lentils, spinach, tofu, and whole grain cereals as well as animal foods like red meat, poultry, tuna, and pork. Ideally it is best to eat a combination of both plant and animal sources of iron to maximize absorption.</p><p>Deficiency in Children</p><p>Not getting enough iron can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Symptoms include headache, pale skin, fatigue, decreased appetite, shortness of breath, and decreased immunity. Deficiencies may also be accelerated by an excessive amount of calcium intake; kids who overconsume milk may be at greater risk.</p><p>� PROBIOTICS �</p><p>Function</p><p>Probiotics are healthy bacteria that keep the digestive system working properly. Getting enough can be very helpful for children with food intolerances or who are prone to other gastrointestinal conditions like diarrhea and reflux.</p><p>Needs</p><p>Like omega-3 fats, there are no established guidelines for probiotic intake. What is most important with probiotics is that intake is consistent and a regular fixture in the diet. Occasional consumption is not going to have the desired effects.</p><p>Sources</p><p>Children&#x2019;s probiotic supplements exist, but in many cases, natural food sources should be parents&#x2019; first choice. You will find these healthy bacteria in yogurt and kefir (a cultured milk product) as well as sourdough bread and fermented foods like miso. There are also some naturally existing probiotics in breast milk, and infant formulas are often fortified.</p><p>Deficiency in Children</p><p>Bouts of diarrhea, illnesses, or taking antibiotics tend to wipe out much of the healthy bacteria along the digestive tract, making children deficient in what they need for normal digestion.
